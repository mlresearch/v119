  abstract =   {In model-based reinforcement learning, planning with an imperfect model of the environment has the potential to harm learning progress. But even when a model is imperfect, it may still contain information that is useful for planning. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using an imperfect model selectively. The agent should plan in parts of the state space where the model would be helpful but refrain from using the model where it would be harmful. An effective selective planning mechanism requires estimating predictive uncertainty, which arises out of aleatoric uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model inadequacy, among other sources. Prior work has focused on parameter uncertainty for selective planning. In this work, we emphasize the importance of model inadequacy. We show that heteroscedastic regression can signal predictive uncertainty arising from model inadequacy that is complementary to that which is detected by methods designed for parameter uncertainty, indicating that considering both parameter uncertainty and model inadequacy may be a more promising direction for effective selective planning than either in isolation.}

  abstract =   {Many real-world problems require trading off multiple competing objectives. However, these objectives are often in different units and/or scales, which can make it challenging for practitioners to express numerical preferences over objectives in their native units. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning that enables setting desired preferences for objectives in a scale-invariant way. We propose to learn an action distribution for each objective, and we use supervised learning to fit a parametric policy to a combination of these distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging high-dimensional real and simulated robotics tasks, and show that setting different preferences in our framework allows us to trace out the space of nondominated solutions.}

  abstract =   {We study the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. Inspired by the extended value iteration algorithm used in optimistic algorithms for finite MDPs, we propose to relax the optimistic optimization of \ofulq and cast it into a constrained \emph{extended} LQR problem, where an additional control variable implicitly selects the system dynamics within a confidence interval. We then move to the corresponding Lagrangian formulation for which we prove strong duality. As a result, we show that an $\epsilon$-optimistic controller can be computed efficiently by solving at most $O\big(\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$ Riccati equations. Finally, we prove that relaxing the original \ofu problem does not impact the learning performance, thus recovering the $\wt O(\sqrt{T})$ regret of \ofulq. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computationally efficient confidence-based algorithm for LQR with worst-case optimal regret guarantees.}

  abstract =   {In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no closed-form, and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates for the estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to chose between them.}

To achieve this, archetypes are learned via sparse projection of data. In the transformed space, GAA employs an iterative subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is considerably faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classification, data visualization/categorization.}

  abstract =   {Local differential privacy (LDP) is a strong notion of privacy that often leads to a significant drop in utility. The original definition of LDP assumes that all the elements in the data domain are equally sensitive. However, in many real-life applications, some elements are more sensitive than others. We propose a context-aware framework for LDP that allows the privacy level to vary across the data domain, enabling system designers to place privacy constraints where they matter without paying the cost where they do not. For binary data domains, we provide a universally optimal privatization scheme and highlight its connections to Warner's randomized response and Mangat's improved response. Motivated by geo-location and web search applications, for k-ary data domains, we consider two special cases of context-aware LDP: block-structured LDP and high-low LDP. We study minimax discrete distribution estimation under both cases and provide communication-efficient, sample-optimal schemes, and information-theoretic lower bounds. We show, using worst-case analyses and experiments on Gowalla's 3.6 million check-ins to 43,750 locations, that context-aware LDP achieves a far better accuracy under the same number of samples.}

We consider two intervention cost models: (1) a linear cost model where the cost of an intervention on a subset of variables has a linear form, and (2) an identity cost model where the cost of an intervention is the same, regardless of what variables it is on, i.e., the goal is just to minimize the number of interventions. Under the linear cost model, we give an algorithm to identify the ancestral relations of the underlying causal graph, achieving within a $2$-factor of the optimal intervention cost. This approximation factor can be improved to $1+\eps$ for any $\eps > 0$ under some mild restrictions. Under the identity cost model, we bound the number of interventions needed to recover the entire causal graph, including the latent variables, using a parameterization of the causal graph through a special type of colliders. In particular, we introduce the notion of $p$-colliders, that are colliders between pair of nodes arising from a specific type of conditioning in the causal graph, and provide an upper bound on the number of interventions as a function of the maximum number of $p$-colliders between any two nodes in the causal graph.}

  abstract =   {Modern deep learning models employ considerably more parameters than required to fit the training data. Whereas conventional statistical wisdom suggests such models should drastically overfit, in practice these models generalize remarkably well. An emerging paradigm for describing this unexpected behavior is in terms of a \emph{double descent} curve, in which increasing a model's capacity causes its test error to first decrease, then increase to a maximum near the interpolation threshold, and then decrease again in the overparameterized regime. Recent efforts to explain this phenomenon theoretically have focused on simple settings, such as linear regression or kernel regression with unstructured random features, which we argue are too coarse to reveal important nuances of actual neural networks. We provide a precise high-dimensional asymptotic analysis of generalization under kernel regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel, which characterizes the behavior of wide neural networks optimized with gradient descent. Our results reveal that the test error has nonmonotonic behavior deep in the overparameterized regime and can even exhibit additional peaks and descents when the number of parameters scales quadratically with the dataset size.}

  abstract =   {Rank aggregation from pairwise preferences has widespread applications in recommendation systems and information retrieval. Given the enormous economic and societal impact of these applications, and the consequent incentives for malicious players to manipulate ranking outcomes in their favor, an important challenge is to make rank aggregation algorithms robust to adversarial manipulations in data. In this paper, we initiate the study of robustness in rank aggregation under the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. We consider a setting where pairwise comparisons are initially generated according to a BTL model, but a fraction of these comparisons are corrupted by an adversary prior to being reported to us. We consider a strong contamination model, where an adversary having complete knowledge of the initial truthful data and the underlying true BTL parameters, can subsequently corrupt the truthful data by inserting, deleting, or changing data points. The goal is to estimate the true score/weight of each item under the BTL model, even in the presence of these corruptions. We characterize the extent of adversarial corruption under which the true BTL parameters are uniquely identifiable. We also provide a novel pruning algorithm that provably cleans the data of adversarial corruption under reasonable conditions on data generation and corruption. We corroborate our theory with experiments on both synthetic as well as real data showing that previous algorithms are vulnerable to even small amounts of corruption, whereas our algorithm can clean a reasonably high amount of corruption.}

We demonstrate that recent off-policy deep RL algorithms, even when trained solely on this fixed dataset, outperform the fully trained DQN agent. To enhance generalization in the offline setting, we present Random Ensemble Mixture (REM), a robust Q-learning algorithm that enforces optimal Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of multiple Q-value estimates. Offline REM trained on the DQN replay dataset surpasses strong RL baselines. Ablation studies highlight the role of offline dataset size and diversity as well as the algorithm choice in our positive results. Overall, the results here present an optimistic view that robust RL algorithms trained on sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can lead to high quality policies. The DQN replay dataset can serve as an offline RL benchmark and is open-sourced.}

Starting from a tight variational representation of the f-divergence, we derive a generalization of the moment generating function, which we show exactly characterizes the best lower bound of the f-divergence as a function of a given IPM. Using this characterization, we obtain new bounds on IPMs defined by classes of unbounded functions, while also recovering in a unified manner well-known results for bounded and subgaussian functions (e.g. Pinsker's inequality and Hoeffding's lemma).}

From the purely observational data, the true causal graph can be identified up to a Markov Equivalence Class (MEC), which is a set of DAGs with the same conditional independencies between the variables. The size of an MEC is a measure of complexity for recovering the true causal graph by performing interventions. We propose a method for efficient iteration over possible MECs given intervention results. We utilize the proposed method for computing MEC sizes and experiment design in active and passive learning settings. Compared to previous work for computing the size of MEC, our proposed algorithm reduces the time complexity by a factor of $O(n)$ for sparse graphs where $n$ is the number of variables in the system. Additionally, integrating our approach with dynamic programming, we design an optimal algorithm for passive experiment design. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms for both computing the size of MEC and experiment design outperform the state of the art.}

Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automate the design of a solver while relying less on sophisticated domain knowledge of the target problem. However, the existing DRL solvers determine the solution using a number of stages proportional to the number of elements in the solution, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a novel DRL scheme, coined learning what to defer (LwD), where the agent adaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to distribute the element-wise decisions of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed framework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also show that LwD can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs having millions of vertices, under a limited time budget.}

Training on data from many environments and finding invariant predictors reduces the effect of spurious features by concentrating models on features that have a causal relationship with the outcome. In this work, we pose such invariant risk minimization as finding the Nash equilibrium of an ensemble game among several environments. By doing so, we develop a simple training algorithm that uses best response dynamics and, in our experiments, yields similar or better empirical accuracy with much lower variance than the challenging bi-level optimization problem of Arjovsky et al. (2019). One key theoretical contribution is showing that the set of Nash equilibria for the proposed game are equivalent to the set of invariant predictors for any finite number of environments, even with nonlinear classifiers and transformations. As a result, our method also retains the generalization guarantees to a large set of environments shown in Arjovsky et al. (2019). The proposed algorithm adds to the collection of successful game-theoretic machine learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks.}

However, we note that infinite Bayesian neural networks lack a key facet of the behaviour of real neural networks: the fixed kernel, determined only by network hyperparameters, implies that they cannot do any form of representation learning. The lack of representation or equivalently kernel learning leads to less flexibility and hence worse performance, giving a potential explanation for the inferior performance of infinite networks observed in the literature (e.g. Novak et al. 2019). We give analytic results characterising the prior over representations and representation learning in finite deep linear networks. We show empirically that the representations in SOTA architectures such as ResNets trained with SGD are much closer to those suggested by our deep linear results than by the corresponding infinite network. This motivates the introduction of a new class of network: infinite networks with bottlenecks, which inherit the theoretical tractability of infinite networks while at the same time allowing representation learning.}

Existing methods for uncertainty quantification are based predominantly on Bayesian neural networks; these may fall short of (1) and (2) {---} i.e., Bayesian credible intervals do not guarantee frequentist coverage, and approximate posterior inference undermines discriminative accuracy. In this paper, we develop the discriminative jackknife (DJ), a frequentist procedure that utilizes influence functions of a model's loss functional to construct a jackknife (or leave one-out) estimator of predictive confidence intervals. The DJ satisfies (1) and (2), is applicable to a wide range of deep learning models, is easy to implement, and can be applied in a post-hoc fashion without interfering with model training or compromising its accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DJ performs competitively compared to existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian regression baselines.}

Our method derives predictive uncertainty from the variability of the (jackknife) sampling distribution of the RNN outputs, which is estimated by repeatedly deleting ``blocks'' of (temporally-correlated) training data, and collecting the predictions of the RNN re-trained on the remaining data. To avoid exhaustive re-training, we utilize influence functions to estimate the effect of removing training data blocks on the learned RNN parameters. Using data from a critical care setting, we demonstrate the utility of uncertainty quantification in sequential decision-making.}

In addition to adapting to sparsity, our method attains fast convergence guarantees in favorable cases \emph{without any modifications}. In particular, we prove linear convergence under metric subregularity, which applies to strongly convex-strongly concave problems and piecewise linear quadratic functions. We show almost sure convergence of the sequence and optimal sublinear convergence rates for the primal-dual gap and objective values, in the general convex-concave case. Numerical evidence demonstrates the state-of-the-art empirical performance of our method in sparse and dense settings, matching and improving the existing methods.}

In practice, these algorithms are used with a constant first-order moment parameter $\beta_{1}$ (typically between $0.9$ and $0.99$). In theory, regret guarantees for online convex optimization require a rapidly decaying $\beta_{1}\to0$ schedule. We show that this is an artifact of the standard analysis, and we propose a novel framework that allows us to derive optimal, data-dependent regret bounds with a constant $\beta_{1}$, without further assumptions. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our analysis on a wide range of different algorithms and settings.}

  abstract =   {Label shift refers to the phenomenon where the prior class probability p(y) changes between the training and test distributions, while the conditional probability p(x|y) stays fixed. Label shift arises in settings like medical diagnosis, where a classifier trained to predict disease given symptoms must be adapted to scenarios where the baseline prevalence of the disease is different. Given estimates of p(y|x) from a predictive model, Saerens et al. proposed an efficient maximum likelihood algorithm to correct for label shift that does not require model retraining, but a limiting assumption of this algorithm is that p(y|x) is calibrated, which is not true of modern neural networks. Recently, Black Box Shift Learning (BBSL) and Regularized Learning under Label Shifts (RLLS) have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques to cope with label shift when a classifier does not output calibrated probabilities, but both methods require model retraining with importance weights and neither has been benchmarked against maximum likelihood. Here we (1) show that combining maximum likelihood with a type of calibration we call bias-corrected calibration outperforms both BBSL and RLLS across diverse datasets and distribution shifts, (2) prove that the maximum likelihood objective is concave, and (3) introduce a principled strategy for estimating source-domain priors that improves robustness to poor calibration. This work demonstrates that the maximum likelihood with appropriate calibration is a formidable and efficient baseline for label shift adaptation; notebooks reproducing experiments available at https://github.com/kundajelab/labelshiftexperiments , video: https://youtu.be/ZBXjE9QTruE , blogpost: https://bit.ly/3kTds7J}

We give a bound on the excess risk of stochastic gradient flow at time $t$, over ridge regression with tuning parameter $\lambda = 1/t$. The bound may be computed from explicit constants (e.g., the mini-batch size, step size, number of iterations), revealing precisely how these quantities drive the excess risk. Numerical examples show the bound can be small, indicating a tight relationship between the two estimators. We give a similar result relating the coefficients of stochastic gradient flow and ridge. These results hold under no conditions on the data matrix $X$, and across the entire optimization path (not just at convergence).}

We introduce a new approach to any-code completion that leverages the strict syntax of programming languages to model a code snippet as a tree - structural language modeling (SLM). SLM estimates the probability of the program's abstract syntax tree (AST) by decomposing it into a product of conditional probabilities over its nodes. We present a neural model that computes these conditional probabilities by considering all AST paths leading to a target node. Unlike previous techniques that have severely restricted the kinds of expressions that can be generated in this task, our approach can generate arbitrary code in any programming language. Our model significantly outperforms both seq2seq and a variety of structured approaches in generating Java and C# code.

To partly address this issue, an important task in statistical relational learning is that of link prediction or knowledge graph completion. Both linear and non-linear models have been proposed to solve the problem. Bilinear models, while expressive, are prone to overfitting and lead to quadratic growth of parameters in number of relations. Simpler models have become more standard, with certain constraints on bilinear map as relation parameters. In this work, we propose a factorized bilinear pooling model, commonly used in multi-modal learning, for better fusion of entities and relations, leading to an efficient and constraint-free model. We prove that our model is fully expressive, providing bounds on the embedding dimensionality and factorization rank. Our model naturally generalizes Tucker decomposition based TuckER model, which has been shown to generalize other models, as efficient low-rank approximation without substantially compromising the performance. Due to low-rank approximation, the model complexity can be controlled by the factorization rank, avoiding the possible cubic growth of TuckER. Empirically, we evaluate on real-world datasets, reaching on par or state-of-the-art performance. At extreme low-ranks, model preserves the performance while staying parameter efficient.}

Yet the exact nature of this regularizer has not been investigated. In this work, we fill in this gap. For several Temporal-Difference (TD) learning methods, we show an explicit equivalence between using a reduced discount factor and adding an explicit regularization term to the algorithm's loss. Motivated by the equivalence, we empirically study this technique compared to standard L2 regularization by extensive experiments in discrete and continuous domains, using tabular and functional representations. Our experiments suggest the regularization effectiveness is strongly related to properties of the available data, such as size, distribution, and mixing rate.}

However, recent advances in this area are still primarily driven by perception improvements (e.g. scene graph generation) rather than reasoning. Neuro-symbolic models such as Neural Module Networks bring the benefits of compositional reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning, and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own. To address this, we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this end, we introduce a Differentiable First-Order Logic formalism for VQA that explicitly decouples question answering from visual perception. On the challenging GQA dataset, this framework is used to perform in-depth, disentangled comparisons between well-known VQA models leading to informative insights regarding the participating models as well as the task.}

We show applications in a synthetic energy-based structured prediction task and in non-convex continuous control.

We support this finding both through theoretical bounds and numerical simulations.}

Specifically, we show that, for any classifier $g$, one can always construct another classifier $\tilde{g}$ which has the same behavior on the data (same train, validation, and test error) but has arbitrarily manipulated explanation maps. We derive this statement theoretically using differential geometry and demonstrate it experimentally for various explanation methods, architectures, and datasets. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we then propose a modification of existing explanation methods which makes them significantly more robust.}

The cost and latency of wet-lab experiments requires methods that find good sequences in few experimental rounds of large batches of sequences --- a setting that off-the-shelf black-box optimization methods are ill-equipped to handle. We find that the performance of existing methods varies drastically across optimization tasks, posing a significant obstacle to real-world applications. To improve robustness, we propose Population-Based Black-Box Optimization (P3BO), which generates batches of sequences by sampling from an ensemble of methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is proportional to the quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to combine the strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness. Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary optimization further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on in-silico optimization tasks, we show that P3BO outperforms any single method in its population, proposing higher quality sequences as well as more diverse batches. As such, P3BO and Adaptive-P3BO are a crucial step towards deploying ML to real-world sequence design.}

We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms to show how to make the setup robust.

It becomes important for ML systems in critical applications to accurately quantify its predictive uncertainty and screen out these anomalous inputs. However, existing OoD detection approaches are prone to errors and even sometimes assign higher likelihoods to OoD samples. Unlike standard learning tasks, there is currently no well established guiding principle for designing OoD detection architectures that can accurately quantify uncertainty. To address these problems, we first seek to identify guiding principles for designing uncertainty-aware architectures, by proposing Neural Architecture Distribution Search (NADS). NADS searches for a distribution of architectures that perform well on a given task, allowing us to identify common building blocks among all uncertainty-aware architectures. With this formulation, we are able to optimize a stochastic OoD detection objective and construct an ensemble of models to perform OoD detection. We perform multiple OoD detection experiments and observe that our NADS performs favorably, with up to 57\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods among 15 different testing configurations.}

Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model, we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack of representation error, invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.}

To build better insight into the behavior of Nesterov's method in stochastic settings, we focus throughout on objectives that are smooth, strongly-convex, and twice continuously differentiable. In the stochastic approximation setting, Nesterov's method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal point at the same accelerated rate as in the deterministic setting. Perhaps surprisingly, in the finite-sum setting, we prove that Nesterov's method may diverge with the usual choice of step-size and momentum, unless additional conditions on the problem related to conditioning and data coherence are satisfied. Our results shed light as to why Nesterov's method may fail to converge or achieve acceleration in the finite-sum setting.}

  abstract =   {We give safe screening rules to eliminate variables from regression with $\ell_0$ regularization or cardinality constraint. These rules are based on guarantees that a feature may or may not be selected in an optimal solution. The screening rules can be computed from a convex relaxation solution in linear time, without solving the L0-optimization problem. Thus, they can be used in a preprocessing step to safely remove variables from consideration apriori. Numerical experiments on real and synthetic data indicate that a significant number of the variables can be removed quickly, hence reducing the computational burden for optimization substantially. Therefore, the proposed fast and effective screening rules extend the scope of algorithms for L0-regression to larger data sets.}

We give upper and lower bounds for the adversarial empirical Rademacher complexity of linear hypotheses with adversarial perturbations measured in $l_r$-norm for an arbitrary $r \geq 1$. We then extend our analysis to provide Rademacher complexity lower and upper bounds for a single ReLU unit. Finally, we give adversarial Rademacher complexity bounds for feed-forward neural networks with one hidden layer.}

We formalize this question as follows: an (n,m) amplification procedure takes as input n independent draws from an unknown distribution D, and outputs a set of m > n ``samples'' which must be indistinguishable from m samples drawn iid from D. We consider this sample amplification problem in two fundamental settings: the case where D is an arbitrary discrete distribution supported on k elements, and the case where D is a d-dimensional Gaussian with unknown mean, and fixed covariance matrix. Perhaps surprisingly, we show a valid amplification procedure exists for both of these settings, even in the regime where the size of the input dataset, n, is significantly less than what would be necessary to learn distribution D to non-trivial accuracy. We also show that our procedures are optimal up to constant factors. Beyond these results, we describe potential applications of such data amplification, and formalize a number of curious directions for future research along this vein.}

There has been a lot of work to analyze the sparsity guarantees of various algorithms (LASSO, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)) in terms of the Restricted Condition Number $\kappa$. The best known algorithms guarantee to find an approximate solution of value $f(x^*)+\epsilon$ with the sparsity bound of $\gamma = O\left(\kappa\min\left\{\log \frac{f(x^0)-f(x^*)}{\epsilon}, \kappa\right\}\right)$, where $x^*$ is the target solution. We present a new Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding (ARHT) algorithm that makes significant progress on this problem by bringing the bound down to $\gamma=O(\kappa)$, which has been shown to be tight for a general class of algorithms including LASSO, OMP, and IHT. This is achieved without significant sacrifice in the runtime efficiency compared to the fastest known algorithms. We also provide a new analysis of OMP with Replacement (OMPR) for general $f$, under the condition $s > s^* \frac{\kappa^2}{4}$, which yields Compressed Sensing bounds under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). When compared to other Compressed Sensing approaches, it has the advantage of providing a strong tradeoff between the RIP condition and the solution sparsity, while working for any general function $f$ that meets the RIP condition.}

We propose a model based RL algorithm that is based on the optimism principle: In each episode, the set of models that are `consistent' with the data collected is constructed. The criterion of consistency is based on the total squared error that the model incurs on the task of predicting \emph{state values} as determined by the last value estimate along the transitions. The next value function is then chosen by solving the optimistic planning problem with the constructed set of models. We derive a bound on the regret, which, in the special case of linear mixtures, takes the form $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H$, $T$ and $d$ are the horizon, the total number of steps and the dimension of $\theta$, respectively. In particular, this regret bound is independent of the total number of states or actions, and is close to a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{HdT})$. For a general model family $\mathcal{P}$, the regret bound is derived based on the Eluder dimension.}

However, the popular graph neural networks are currently limited in modeling data only via Euclidean geometry and associated vector space operations. Here, we bridge this gap by proposing mathematically grounded generalizations of graph convolutional networks (GCN) to (products of) constant curvature spaces. We do this by i) introducing a unified formalism permitting a differentiable interpolation between all geometries of constant curvature irrespective of their sign, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric coordinates that generalize the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass. Our class of models smoothly recover their Euclidean counterparts when the curvature goes to zero from either side. Empirically, we outperform Euclidean GCNs in the tasks of node classification and distortion minimization for symbolic data exhibiting non-Euclidean behavior, according to their discrete curvature.}

More formally, we introduce a model in which a recommendation system faces an exploration-exploitation tradeoff under the constraint that it can never recommend any action that it knows yields lower reward in expectation than an agent would achieve if it acted alone. Our main contribution is a positive result: an asymptotically optimal, incentive compatible, and ex-ante individually rational recommendation algorithm.}

  abstract =   {Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles), resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across a variety of synthetic and real-world biases; our experiments show that the method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved generalisation.

However, the majority of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only applies to the setting where the agent plays against a fixed environment; it remains largely open whether self-play algorithms can be provably effective, especially when it is necessary to manage the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. We study self-play in competitive reinforcement learning under the setting of Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision processes to the two-player case. We introduce a self-play algorithm---Value Iteration with Upper/Lower Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB)---and show that it achieves regret $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ after playing $T$ steps of the game, where the regret is measured by the agent's performance against a fully adversarial opponent who can exploit the agent's strategy at any step. We also introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves a slightly worse regret of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to run in polynomial time even in the worst case. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first line of provably sample-efficient self-play algorithms for competitive reinforcement learning.}

Besides, SSC+E makes use of Gaussian kernel to compute the sparse similarity matrix of objects, which can avoid the complex computation of the sparse optimization program of SSC.

Our main result is a near-linear time construction of a coreset for k-Median in a general graph $G$, with size $O_{\epsilon, k}(\mathrm{tw}(G))$ where $\mathrm{tw}(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$, and we complement the construction with a nearly-tight size lower bound. The construction is based on the framework of Feldman and Langberg [STOC 2011], and our main technical contribution, as required by this framework, is a uniform bound of $O(\mathrm{tw}(G))$ on the shattering dimension under any point weights. We validate our coreset on real-world road networks, and our scalable algorithm constructs tiny coresets with high accuracy, which translates to a massive speedup of existing approximation algorithms such as local search for graph k-Median.}

We investigate a fundamental question about these techniques: how large should the training set be to ensure that a parameter's average empirical performance over the training set is close to its expected, future performance? We answer this question for algorithm configuration problems that exhibit a widely-applicable structure: the algorithm's performance as a function of its parameters can be approximated by a ``simple'' function. We show that if this approximation holds under the L$\infty$-norm, we can provide strong sample complexity bounds, but if the approximation holds only under the Lp-norm for p < $\infty$, it is not possible to provide meaningful sample complexity bounds in the worst case. We empirically evaluate our bounds in the context of integer programming, obtaining sample complexity bounds that are up to 700 times smaller than the previously best-known bounds.}

In this paper we introduce Ready Policy One (RP1), a framework that views MBRL as an active learning problem, where we aim to improve the world model in the fewest samples possible. RP1 achieves this by utilizing a hybrid objective function, which crucially adapts during optimization, allowing the algorithm to trade off reward v.s. exploration at different stages of learning. In addition, we introduce a principled mechanism to terminate sample collection once we have a rich enough trajectory batch to improve the model. We rigorously evaluate our method on a variety of continuous control tasks, and demonstrate statistically significant gains over existing approaches.}

  abstract =   {Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data.}

In these settings, requests arrive sequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker needs to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and generates revenue. The revenue function and resource consumption of each request are drawn independently and at random from a probability distribution that is unknown to the decision maker. The objective is to maximize cumulative revenues subject to a constraint on the total consumption of resources. We design a general class of algorithms that achieve sub-linear expected regret compared to the hindsight optimal allocation. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual space: they maintain a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using online mirror descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover dual sub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting algorithms are simple, efficient, and shown to attain the optimal order of regret when the length of the horizon and the initial number of resources are scaled proportionally. We discuss applications to online bidding in repeated auctions with budget constraints and online proportional matching with high entropy.}

  abstract =   {The problem of scheduling of workloads onto heterogeneous processors (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) is of fundamental importance in modern data centers. Current system schedulers rely on application/system-specific heuristics that have to be built on a case-by-case basis. Recent work has demonstrated ML techniques for automating the heuristic search by using black-box approaches which require significant training data and time, which make them challenging to use in practice. This paper presents Symphony, a scheduling framework that addresses the challenge in two ways: (i) a domain-driven Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) model for scheduling, which inherently models the resource dependencies identified from the system architecture; and (ii) a sampling-based technique to compute the gradients of a Bayesian model without performing full probabilistic inference. Together, these techniques reduce both the amount of training data and the time required to produce scheduling policies that significantly outperform black-box approaches by up to 2.2{\texttimes}.}

Given an input text with masked tokens, we rely on conventional masks to learn inter-relations between corrupted tokens and context via autoencoding, and pseudo masks to learn intra-relations between masked spans via partially autoregressive modeling. With well-designed position embeddings and self-attention masks, the context encodings are reused to avoid redundant computation. Moreover, conventional masks used for autoencoding provide global masking information, so that all the position embeddings are accessible in partially autoregressive language modeling. In addition, the two tasks pre-train a unified language model as a bidirectional encoder and a sequence-to-sequence decoder, respectively. Our experiments show that the unified language models pre-trained using PMLM achieve new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks across several widely used benchmarks.

Proximal gradient methods are used as standard approaches to solve OWL regression. However, it is still a burning issue to solve OWL regression due to considerable computational cost and memory usage when the feature or sample size is large. In this paper, we propose the first safe screening rule for OWL regression by exploring the order of the primal solution with the unknown order structure via an iterative strategy, which overcomes the difficulties of tackling the non-separable regularizer. It effectively avoids the updates of the parameters whose coefficients must be zero during the learning process. More importantly, the proposed screening rule can be easily applied to standard and stochastic proximal gradient methods. Moreover, we prove that the algorithms with our screening rule are guaranteed to have identical results with the original algorithms. Experimental results on a variety of datasets show that our screening rule leads to a significant computational gain without any loss of accuracy, compared to existing competitive algorithms.}

Incorporating modes associated with higher graph frequencies unravels domain subtleties, which are shown to be useful for option discovery.

For this purpose, we propose to estimate the neighborhood of each node by maximizing a penalized version of its conditional log-likelihood. The objective of the penalization is twofold: it imposes sparsity in the learned graphs and, thanks to a fused-type penalty, it also enforces them to evolve piece-wise constantly. Using few assumptions, we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those are the first in the context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying Ising model. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset demonstrate the performance of our method.}

As realistic training sets are not drawn from a uniform distribution, we here use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) model to explore the effect of variable density on training dynamics. Our results, which combine analytic and empirical observations, show that when learning a pure harmonic function of frequency $\kappa$, convergence at a point $x \in \S^{d-1}$ occurs in time $O(\kappa^d/p(x))$ where $p(x)$ denotes the local density at $x$. Specifically, for data in $\S^1$ we analytically derive the eigenfunctions of the kernel associated with the NTK for two-layer networks. We further prove convergence results for deep, fully connected networks with respect to the spectral decomposition of the NTK. Our empirical study highlights similarities and differences between deep and shallow networks in this model.}

Often ad-hoc decomposition rules are used to approximately solve these LPs, which have limited optimality guarantees and may lead to sub-optimal performance in practice. In this work, we propose a distributed solver that solves a perturbation of the LP problems at scale via a gradient-based algorithm on the smooth dual of the perturbed LP. The main workhorses of our algorithm are distributed matrix-vector multiplications (with load balancing) and efficient projection operations on distributed machines. Experiments on real-world data show that our proposed LP solver, ECLIPSE, can solve problems with $10^{12}$ decision variables -- well beyond the capabilities of current solvers.}

  abstract =   {With the rapid adoption of machine learning systems in sensitive applications, there is an increasing need to make black-box models explainable. Often we want to identify an influential group of training samples in a particular test prediction for a given machine learning model. Existing influence functions tackle this problem by using first-order approximations of the effect of removing a sample from the training set on model parameters. To compute the influence of a group of training samples (rather than an individual point) in model predictions, the change in optimal model parameters after removing that group from the training set can be large. Thus, in such cases, the first-order approximation can be loose. In this paper, we address this issue and propose second-order influence functions for identifying influential groups in test-time predictions. For linear models, across different sizes and types of groups, we show that using the proposed second-order influence function improves the correlation between the computed influence values and the ground truth ones. We also show that second-order influence functions could be used with optimization techniques to improve the selection of the most influential group for a test-sample.}

We introduce and analyse continuous volume sampling (VS), the continuous counterpart -for choosing node locations- of a discrete distribution introduced in (Deshpande & Vempala, 2006). Our contribution is theoretical: we prove almost optimal bounds for interpolation and quadrature under VS. While similar bounds already exist for some specific RKHSs using ad-hoc node constructions, VS offers bounds that apply to any Mercer kernel and depend on the spectrum of the associated integration operator. We emphasize that, unlike previous randomized approaches that rely on regularized leverage scores or determinantal point processes, evaluating the pdf of VS only requires pointwise evaluations of the kernel. VS is thus naturally amenable to MCMC samplers.}

In recent years multiple authors have considered alternatives that can alleviate this issue. In this context, we consider a simpler, but more effective, substitute that uses minimal feedback, which we call Decoupled Greedy Learning (DGL). It is based on a greedy relaxation of the joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We consider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the layer training, allowing for layers or modules in networks to be trained with a potentially linear parallelization in layers. We show theoretically and empirically that this approach converges. Then, we empirically find that it can lead to better generalization than sequential greedy optimization and sometimes end-to-end back-propagation. We show an extension of this approach to asynchronous settings, where modules can operate with large communication delays, is possible with the use of a replay buffer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DGL on the CIFAR-10 dataset against alternatives and on the large-scale ImageNet dataset.}

  abstract =   {We consider the problem of selecting the best estimator among a family of Tikhonov regularized estimators, or, alternatively, to select a linear combination of these regularizers that is as good as the best regularizer in the family. Our theory reveals that if the Tikhonov regularizers share the same penalty matrix with different tuning parameters, a convex procedure based on $Q$-aggregation achieves the mean square error of the best estimator, up to a small error term no larger than $C\sigma^2$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise level and $C>0$ is an absolute constant. Remarkably, the error term does not depend on the penalty matrix or the number of estimators as long as they share the same penalty matrix, i.e., it applies to any grid of tuning parameters, no matter how large the cardinality of the grid is. This reveals the surprising "cost-free" nature of optimally tuning Tikhonov regularizers, in striking contrast with the existing literature on aggregation of estimators where one typically has to pay a cost of $\sigma^2\log(M)$ where $M$ is the number of estimators in the family. The result holds, more generally, for any family of ordered linear smoothers; this encompasses Ridge regression as well as Principal Component Regression. The result is extended to the problem of tuning Tikhonov regularizers with different penalty matrices.}

We find that TD easily leads to low-interference, under-generalizing parameters, while the effect seems reversed in supervised learning. We hypothesize that the cause can be traced back to the interplay between the dynamics of interference and bootstrapping. This is supported empirically by several observations: the negative relationship between the generalization gap and interference in TD, the negative effect of bootstrapping on interference and the local coherence of targets, and the contrast between the propagation rate of information in TD(0) versus TD($\lambda$) and regression tasks such as Monte-Carlo policy evaluation. We hope that these new findings can guide the future discovery of better bootstrapping methods.}

In our concrete setting, we allow these choices to be stochastic and model the user's actions by means of the Plackett-Luce model. The learner's main task is to preselect subsets that eventually lead to highly preferred choices. To formalize this goal, we introduce a reasonable notion of regret and derive lower bounds on the expected regret. Moreover, we propose algorithms for which the upper bound on expected regret matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic term of the time horizon.}

We consider the estimation problem given by a weighted surrogate-loss classification with any score function, either direct, inverse-propensity-weighted, or doubly robust. We show that, under a correct specification assumption, the weighted classification formulation need not be efficient for policy parameters. We draw a contrast to actual (possibly weighted) binary classification, where correct specification implies a parametric model, while for policy learning it only implies a semi-parametric model. In light of this, we instead propose an estimation approach based on generalized method of moments, which is efficient for the policy parameters. We propose a particular method based on recent developments on solving moment problems using neural networks and demonstrate the efficiency and regret benefits of this method empirically.}

In this work, we explicitly exploit this interpolation property for the design of a new optimization algorithm for deep learning, which we term Adaptive Learning-rates for Interpolation with Gradients (ALI-G). ALI-G retains the two main advantages of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which are (i) a low computational cost per iteration and (ii) good generalization performance in practice. At each iteration, ALI-G exploits the interpolation property to compute an adaptive learning-rate in closed form. In addition, ALI-G clips the learning-rate to a maximal value, which we prove to be helpful for non-convex problems. Crucially, in contrast to the learning-rate of SGD, the maximal learning-rate of ALI-G does not require a decay schedule. This makes ALI-G considerably easier to tune than SGD. We prove the convergence of ALI-G in various stochastic settings. Notably, we tackle the realistic case where the interpolation property is satisfied up to some tolerance. We also provide experiments on a variety of deep learning architectures and tasks: (i) learning a differentiable neural computer; (ii) training a wide residual network on the SVHN data set; (iii) training a Bi-LSTM on the SNLI data set; and (iv) training wide residual networks and densely connected networks on the CIFAR data sets. ALI-G produces state-of-the-art results among adaptive methods, and even yields comparable performance with SGD, which requires manually tuned learning-rate schedules. Furthermore, ALI-G is simple to implement in any standard deep learning framework and can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing code.}

  abstract =   {Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously difficult, though crucial for obtaining the best accuracy. The most popular hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search on a held-out dataset. However, grid-search requires to choose a predefined grid of parameters and scales exponentially in the number of parameters. Another class of approaches casts hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, typically solved by gradient descent. The key challenge for these approaches is the estimation of the gradient w.r.t. the hyperparameters. Computing that gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation usually suffers from high memory consumption, while implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable. In addition, implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case of Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our proposal scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods for hyperparameter optimization.}

Rather surprisingly, it was shown that if the hint vector is guaranteed to have a positive correlation with the cost vector, then the online player can achieve a regret of $O(\log T)$, thus significantly improving over the $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the general setting. However, the result and analysis require the correlation property at \emph{all} time steps, thus raising the natural question: can we design online learning algorithms that are resilient to bad hints? In this paper we develop algorithms and nearly matching lower bounds for online learning with imperfect hints. Our algorithms are oblivious to the quality of the hints, and the regret bounds interpolate between the always-correlated hints case and the no-hints case.

In this work, we study general non-parametric methods, with a view towards understanding when they are robust to these modifications. We establish general conditions under which non-parametric methods are r-consistent -- in the sense that they converge to optimally robust and accurate classifiers in the large sample limit. Concretely, our results show that when data is well-separated, nearest neighbors and kernel classifiers are r-consistent, while histograms are not. For general data distributions, we prove that preprocessing by Adversarial Pruning (Yang et. al., 2019)-- that makes data well-separated -- followed by nearest neighbors or kernel classifiers also leads to r-consistency.}

Our goal is to give algorithms with polynomial time and sample complexity in a non-parametric setting. Tian and Pearl (AAAI '02) have exactly characterized the class of causal graphs for which causal effects of atomic interventions can be identified from observational data. We make their result quantitative. Suppose 𝒫 is a causal model on a set V of n observable variables with respect to a given causal graph G, and let do(x) be an identifiable intervention on a variable X. We show that assuming that G has bounded in-degree and bounded c-components (k) and that the observational distribution satisfies a strong positivity condition: (i) [Evaluation] There is an algorithm that outputs with probability 2/3 an evaluator for a distribution P^ that satisfies TV(P(V | do(x)), P^(V)) < eps using m=O~(n/eps^2) samples from P and O(mn) time. The evaluator can return in O(n) time the probability P^(v) for any assignment v to V. (ii) [Sampling] There is an algorithm that outputs with probability 2/3 a sampler for a distribution P^ that satisfies TV(P(V | do(x)), P^(V)) < eps using m=O~(n/eps^2) samples from P and O(mn) time. The sampler returns an iid sample from P^ with probability 1 in O(n) time. We extend our techniques to estimate P(Y | do(x)) for a subset Y of variables of interest. We also show lower bounds for the sample complexity, demonstrating that our sample complexity has optimal dependence on the parameters n and eps, as well as if k=1 on the strong positivity parameter.}

In this paper we show that $O^*(dk/m)$ samples are sufficient to learn each of $k-$ topic vectors of LDA, a popular Ad-mixture model, with vocabulary size $d$ and $m\in \Omega(1)$ words per document, to any constant error in $L_1$ norm. The result is a corollary of the major contribution of this paper: the first sample complexity upper bound for the problem (introduced in \cite{BK20}) of learning the vertices of a Latent $k-$ Polytope in $\RR^d$, given perturbed points from it. The bound, $O^*(dk/\beta)$, is optimal and linear in number of parameters. It applies to many stochastic models including a broad class Ad-mixtures. To demonstrate the generality of the approach we specialize the setting to Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Models(MMSB) and show for the first time that if an MMSB has $k$ blocks, the sample complexity is $O^*(k^2)$ under usual assumptions.}

In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling.}

SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster. However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.}

Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational data assume that there are no hidden confounders, an assumption that is not testable in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects in the presence of multi-cause hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent; then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that act as substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the Time Series Deconfounder. Using both simulated and real data we show the effectiveness of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses over time.}

The methodology begins by representing the target density as a density, $e^{-U}$, with respect to a prescribed (usually) Gaussian measure and constructs a continuous trajectory consisting of a piecewise circular path. The method moves from one circular orbit to another according to a rate function which can be written in terms of $U$. We demonstrate that the method is easy to implement and demonstrate empirically that it can out-perform existing benchmark piecewise deterministic Markov processes such as the bouncy particle sampler and the Zig-Zag. In the Bayesian statistics context, these competitor algorithms are of substantial interest in the large data context due to the fact that they can adopt data subsampling techniques which are exact (ie induce no error in the stationary distribution). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that we can also construct a control-variate subsampling boomerang sampler which is also exact, and which possesses remarkable scaling properties in the large data limit. We furthermore illustrate a factorised version on the simulation of diffusion bridges.}

However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many kinks where it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator, often used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and least trimmed squares.}

The architecture also enables perfect signal propagation and stable gradients, and achieves high accuracy on standard benchmarks. This indicates that random, diverse initializations are \emph{not} necessary for training neural networks. An essential element in training this network is a mechanism of symmetry breaking; we study this phenomenon and find that standard GPU operations, which are non-deterministic, can serve as a sufficient source of symmetry breaking to enable training.}

Common approaches, which try to model the objective as precisely as possible, often fail to make progress by spending too many evaluations modeling irrelevant details. We address this issue by proposing surrogate models that focus on the well-behaved structure in the objective function, which is informative for search, while ignoring detrimental structure that is challenging to model from few observations. First, we demonstrate that surrogate models with appropriate noise distributions can absorb challenging structures in the objective function by treating them as irreducible uncertainty. Secondly, we show that a latent Gaussian process is an excellent surrogate for this purpose, comparing with Gaussian processes with standard noise distributions. We perform numerous experiments on a range of BO benchmarks and find that our approach improves reliability and performance when faced with challenging objective functions.}

We propose a model-agnostic certificate based on the randomized smoothing framework which subsumes earlier work and is tight, efficient, and sparsity-aware. Its computational complexity does not depend on the number of discrete categories or the dimension of the input (e.g. the graph size), making it highly scalable. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a wide variety of models, datasets, and tasks -- specifically highlighting its use for Graph Neural Networks. So far, obtaining provable guarantees for GNNs has been difficult due to the discrete and non-i.i.d. nature of graph data. Our method can certify any GNN and handles perturbations to both the graph structure and the node attributes.}

By computing the decomposition of the total generalization error due to different spectral components of the kernel, we identify a new spectral principle: as the size of the training set grows, kernel machines and neural networks fit successively higher spectral modes of the target function. When data are sampled from a uniform distribution on a high-dimensional hypersphere, dot product kernels, including NTK, exhibit learning stages where different frequency modes of the target function are learned.

These systematic experiments lead to some interesting and potentially very useful observations; perhaps most notably that training on smaller subsets of the data can lead to more reliable model selection decisions whilst simultaneously enjoying smaller computational overheads. Our experiments furthermore allow us to estimate Minimum Description Lengths for common datasets given modern neural network architectures, thereby paving the way for principled model selection taking into account Occams-razor.}

  abstract =   {The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.}

Despite its nice and generic theoretical regret guarantees, this algorithm and its variants have remained until now mostly theoretical as numerical experiments in simple environments exhibit long burn-in phases before the learning takes place. In pursuit of practical efficiency, we present UCRL3, following the lines of UCRL2, but with two key modifications: First, it uses state-of-the-art time-uniform concentration inequalities to compute confidence sets on the reward and (component-wise) transition distributions for each state-action pair. Furthermore, to tighten exploration, it uses an adaptive computation of the support of each transition distribution, which in turn enables us to revisit the extended value iteration procedure of UCRL2 to optimize over distributions with reduced support by disregarding low probability transitions, while still ensuring near-optimism. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments in standard environments, that reducing exploration this way yields a substantial numerical improvement compared to UCRL2 and its variants. On the theoretical side, these key modifications enable us to derive a regret bound for UCRL3 improving on UCRL2, that for the first time makes appear notions of local diameter and local effective support, thanks to variance-aware concentration bounds.}

This raises the question of whether these models have learned to solve a dataset rather than the underlying task by overfitting to spurious dataset biases. We investigate one recently proposed approach, AFLITE, which adversarially filters such dataset biases, as a means to mitigate the prevalent overestimation of machine performance. We provide a theoretical understanding for AFLITE, by situating it in the generalized framework for optimum bias reduction. We present extensive supporting evidence that AFLITE is broadly applicable for reduction of measurable dataset biases, and that models trained on the filtered datasets yield better generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. Finally, filtering results in a large drop in model performance (e.g., from 92\% to 62\% for SNLI), while human performance still remains high. Our work thus shows that such filtered datasets can pose new research challenges for robust generalization by serving as upgraded benchmarks.}

Empirically, we show that state-of-the-art language models, including LSTMs and Transformers, are miscalibrated: the entropy rates of their generations drift dramatically upward over time. We then provide provable methods to mitigate this phenomenon. Furthermore, we show how this calibration-based approach can also be used to measure the amount of memory that language models use for prediction.}

Many times, large matrices representing real-world data are sparse or doubly sparse (i.e., sparse in both rows and columns), and are accessed as a stream of updates, typically organized in row-order. In this setting, where space (memory) is the limiting resource, all known algorithms require space that is polynomial in the dimension of the matrix, even for sparse matrices. We address this challenge by providing the first algorithms whose space requirement is independent of the matrix dimension, assuming the matrix is doubly-sparse and presented in row-order. Our algorithms approximate the Schatten p-norms, which we use in turn to approximate other spectral functions, such as logarithm of the determinant, trace of matrix inverse, and Estrada index. We validate these theoretical performance bounds by numerical experiments on real-world matrices representing social networks. We further prove that multiple passes are unavoidable in this setting, and show extensions of our primary technique, including a trade-off between space requirements and number of passes.}

However, the tightness of TVO bounds was not previously known, an expensive grid search was used to choose a ``schedule'' of intermediate distributions, and model learning suffered with ostensibly tighter bounds. In this work, we propose an exponential family interpretation of the geometric mixture curve underlying the TVO and various path sampling methods, which allows us to characterize the gap in TVO likelihood bounds as a sum of KL divergences. We propose to choose intermediate distributions using equal spacing in the moment parameters of our exponential family, which matches grid search performance and allows the schedule to adaptively update over the course of training. Finally, we derive a doubly reparameterized gradient estimator which improves model learning and allows the TVO to benefit from more refined bounds. To further contextualize our contributions, we provide a unified framework for understanding thermodynamic integration and the TVO using Taylor series remainders.}

This algorithm achieves the optimal 1-1/e approximation guarantee and is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art on a variety of experiments over real-world data sets. Following recent work by Balkanski and Singer (2018), there has been a great deal of research on algorithms whose theoretical parallel runtime is exponentially faster than algorithms used for submodular maximization over the past 40 years. However, while these new algorithms are fast in terms of asymptotic worst-case guarantees, it is computationally infeasible to use them in practice even on small data sets because the number of rounds and queries they require depend on large constants and high-degree polynomials in terms of precision and confidence. The design principles behind the FAST algorithm we present here are a significant departure from those of recent theoretically fast algorithms. Rather than optimize for asymptotic theoretical guarantees, the design of FAST introduces several new techniques that achieve remarkable practical and theoretical parallel runtimes. The approximation guarantee obtained by FAST is arbitrarily close to 1 - 1/e, and its asymptotic parallel runtime (adaptivity) is O(log(n) log^2(log k)) using O(n log log(k)) total queries. We show that FAST is orders of magnitude faster than any algorithm for submodular maximization we are aware of, including hyper-optimized parallel versions of state-of-the-art serial algorithms, by running experiments on large data sets.}

In GNN-FiLM, the representation of the target node of an edge is used to compute a transformation that can be applied to all incoming messages, allowing feature-wise modulation of the passed information. Different GNN architectures are compared in extensive experiments on three tasks from the literature, using re-implementations of many baseline methods. Hyperparameters for all methods were found using extensive search, yielding somewhat surprising results: differences between state of the art models are much smaller than reported in the literature and well-known simple baselines that are often not compared to perform better than recently proposed GNN variants. Nonetheless, GNN-FiLM outperforms these methods on a regression task on molecular graphs and performs competitively on other tasks.}

We evaluate a range of approaches to batch normalization for meta-learning scenarios, and develop a novel approach that we call TaskNorm. Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate that the choice of batch normalization has a dramatic effect on both classification accuracy and training time for both gradient based- and gradient-free meta-learning approaches. Importantly, TaskNorm is found to consistently improve performance. Finally, we provide a set of best practices for normalization that will allow fair comparison of meta-learning algorithms.}

Bayesian REX can learn to play Atari games from demonstrations, without access to the game score and can generate 100,000 samples from the posterior over reward functions in only 5 minutes on a personal laptop. Bayesian REX also results in imitation learning performance that is competitive with or better than state-of-the-art methods that only learn point estimates of the reward function. Finally, Bayesian REX enables efficient high-confidence policy evaluation without having access to samples of the reward function. These high-confidence performance bounds can be used to rank the performance and risk of a variety of evaluation policies and provide a way to detect reward hacking behaviors.}

As machine learning increases in ubiquity as a backend for automated systems, concerns about fairness arise. Much of the current literature on fairness deals with discrimination against protected classes in supervised learning (group fairness). We define a different notion of fair clustering wherein the probability that two points (or a community of points) become separated is bounded by an increasing function of their pairwise distance (or community diameter). We capture the situation where data points represent people who gain some benefit from being clustered together. Unfairness arises when certain points are deterministically separated, either arbitrarily or by someone who intends to harm them as in the case of gerrymandering election districts. In response, we formally define two new types of fairness in the clustering setting, pairwise fairness and community preservation. To explore the practicality of our fairness goals, we devise an approach for extending existing $k$-center algorithms to satisfy these fairness constraints. Analysis of this approach proves that reasonable approximations can be achieved while maintaining fairness. In experiments, we compare the effectiveness of our approach to classical $k$-center algorithms/heuristics and explore the tradeoff between optimal clustering and fairness.}

The key problem with MOGPs is their computational scaling $O(n^3 p^3)$, which is cubic in the number of both inputs $n$ (e.g., time points or locations) and outputs $p$. For this reason, a popular class of MOGPs assumes that the data live around a low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing the complexity to $O(n^3 m^3)$. However, this cost is still cubic in the dimensionality of the subspace $m$, which is still prohibitively expensive for many applications. We propose the use of a sufficient statistic of the data to accelerate inference and learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method achieves linear scaling in $m$ in practice, allowing these models to scale to large $m$ without sacrificing significant expressivity or requiring approximation. This advance opens up a wide range of real-world tasks and can be combined with existing GP approximations in a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on various synthetic and real-world data sets.}

We assume that the seller already has some pre-existing offline data before the start of the selling horizon. The seller wants to utilize both the pre-existing offline data and the sequential online data to minimize the regret of the online learning process. We characterize the joint effect of the size, location and dispersion of the offline data on the optimal regret of the online learning process. Our results reveal surprising transformations of the optimal regret rate with respect to the size of the offline data, which we refer to as phase transitions. In addition, our results demonstrate that the location and dispersion of the offline data also have an intrinsic effect on the optimal regret, and we quantify this effect via the inverse-square law.}

We perform an empirical study of different aspects of overparameterization in unsupervised learning of latent variable models via synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. We discuss benefits to different metrics of success (recovering the parameters of the ground-truth model, held-out log-likelihood), sensitivity to variations of the training algorithm, and behavior as the amount of overparameterization increases. We find that across a variety of models (noisy-OR networks, sparse coding, probabilistic context-free grammars) and training algorithms (variational inference, alternating minimization, expectation-maximization), overparameterization can significantly increase the number of ground truth latent variables recovered.}

Yet, for network embedding, with applications in vulnerable domains ranging from social network analysis to recommender systems, current options remain limited both in number and performance.

  abstract =   {We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application of auto-encoder in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks with images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning agents.}

  abstract =   {In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm for regression problems called \emph{boosted histogram transform for regression} (BHTR) based on histogram transforms composed of random rotations, stretchings, and translations. From the theoretical perspective, we first prove fast convergence rates for BHTR under the assumption that the target function lies in the spaces $C^{0,\alpha}$. Moreover, if the target function resides in the subspace $C^{1,\alpha}$, by establishing the upper bound of the convergence rate for the boosted regressor, i.e. BHTR, and the lower bound for base regressors, i.e. histogram transform regressors (HTR), we manage to explain the benefits of the boosting procedure. In the experiments, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms such as gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), Breiman's forest, and kernel-based methods, our BHTR algorithm shows promising performance on both synthetic and real datasets.}

Estimation of optimal decision rules (ODR) has been extensively investigated recently, however, at present, no testing procedure is proposed to verify whether these ODRs are significantly better than the naive decision rule that always assigning individuals to a fixed treatment option. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure for detecting the existence of an ODR that is better than the naive decision rule under the randomized trials. We construct the proposed test based on the difference of estimated value functions using the augmented inverse probability weighted method. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses are established. Based on the established asymptotic distributions, we further develop a sample size calculation formula for testing the existence of an ODR in designing A/B tests. Extensive simulations and a real data application to a schizophrenia clinical trial data are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed methods.}

This distributional theory in turn allows one to construct valid and short confidence intervals for both the unseen tensor entries and its underlying tensor factors. The proposed inferential procedure enjoys several important features: (1) it is fully adaptive to noise heteroscedasticity, and (2) it is data-driven and adapts automatically to unknown noise distributions. Furthermore, our findings unveil the statistical optimality of nonconvex tensor completion: it attains un-improvable estimation accuracy --- including both the rates and the pre-constants --- under i.i.d.

This paper proves that, in the problem of episodic Markov decision process with linear function approximation, unknown transition, and adversarial reward with full-information feedback, OPPO achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2 H^3 T})$ regret. Here $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, OPPO is the first provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that explores.}

Experimental time grows linearly with the number of evaluations, unless candidates are selected in batches (e.g., using GP-BUCB) and evaluated in parallel. Furthermore, computational cost is often prohibitive since algorithms such as GP-BUCB require a time at least quadratic in the number of dimensions and iterations to select each batch. In this paper, we introduce BBKB (Batch Budgeted Kernel Bandits), the first no-regret GP optimization algorithm that provably runs in near-linear time and selects candidates in batches. This is obtained with a new guarantee for the tracking of the posterior variances that allows BBKB to choose increasingly larger batches, improving over GP-BUCB. Moreover, we show that the same bound can be used to adaptively delay costly updates to the sparse GP approximation used by BBKB, achieving a near-constant per-step amortized cost. These findings are then confirmed in several experiments, where BBKB is much faster than state-of-the-art methods.}

The method replaces the assignment of label values at training points with the placement of sources and sinks, and solves the resulting Poisson equation on the graph. The outcomes are provably more stable and informative than those of Laplacian learning. Poisson learning is efficient and simple to implement, and we present numerical experiments showing the method is superior to other recent approaches to semi-supervised learning at low label rates on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Cifar-10.

Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that existing algorithms suffer from a common limitation -- they discover options that provide a poor coverage of the state space. In light of this, we propose Explore, Discover and Learn (EDL), an alternative approach to information-theoretic skill discovery. Crucially, EDL optimizes the same information-theoretic objective derived from the empowerment literature, but addresses the optimization problem using different machinery. We perform an extensive evaluation of skill discovery methods on controlled environments and show that EDL offers significant advantages, such as overcoming the coverage problem, reducing the dependence of learned skills on the initial state, and allowing the user to define a prior over which behaviors should be learned.}

Consequently, we introduce a new sampling approach based on the reshaping of the search distribution, and we show both theoretically and numerically that it leads to significant gains over random search. Two methods are proposed for the reshaping: Recentering (when the distribution of the optimum is known), and Cauchy transformation (when the distribution of the optimum is unknown). The proposed methods are first validated on artificial experiments and simple real-world tests on clustering and Salmon mappings. Then we demonstrate that they drive performance improvement in a wide range of expensive artificial intelligence tasks, namely attend/infer/repeat, video next frame segmentation forecasting and progressive generative adversarial networks.}

Unlike prior work, it can efficiently learn distributions over large domains, controllably adjust the representation rates of protected groups and achieve target fairness metrics such as statistical parity, yet remains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset. Our approach leverages the principle of maximum entropy {--} amongst all distributions satisfying a given set of constraints, we should choose the one closest in KL-divergence to a given prior. While maximum entropy distributions can succinctly encode distributions over large domains, they can be difficult to compute. Our main contribution is an instantiation of this framework for our set of constraints and priors, which encode our bias mitigation goals, and that runs in time polynomial in the dimension of the data. Empirically, we observe that samples from the learned distribution have desired representation rates and statistical rates, and when used for training a classifier incurs only a slight loss in accuracy while maintaining fairness properties.}

We first study the benefit of the biased OFUL algorithm in terms of regret minimization. We then propose two strategies to estimate the bias within the learning-to-learn setting. We show both theoretically and experimentally, that when the number of tasks grows and the variance of the task-distribution is small, our strategies have a significant advantage over learning the tasks in isolation.}

In this standard formalization, categories are merely represented as indexes in the label vocabulary, and the model lacks for explicit instructions on what to classify. Inspired by the current trend of formalizing NLP problems as question answering tasks, we propose a new framework for text classification, in which each category label is associated with a category description. Descriptions are generated by hand-crafted templates or using abstractive/extractive models from reinforcement learning. The concatenation of the description and the text is fed to the classifier to decide whether or not the current label should be assigned to the text. The proposed strategy forces the model to attend to the most salient texts with respect to the label, which can be regarded as a hard version of attention, leading to better performances. We observe significant performance boosts over strong baselines on a wide range of text classification tasks including single-label classification, multi-label classification and multi-aspect sentiment analysis.}

One form of explanation of the output of a neural network model in terms of its input features, is a vector of feature-attributions, which can be generated by various techniques such as Integrated Gradients (IG), DeepSHAP, LIME, and CXPlain. Two desirable characteristics of an attribution-based explanation are: (1) \emph{sparseness}: the attributions of irrelevant or weakly relevant features should be negligible, thus resulting in \emph{concise} explanations in terms of the significant features, and (2) \emph{stability}: it should not vary significantly within a small local neighborhood of the input. Our first contribution is a theoretical exploration of how these two properties (when using IG-based attributions) are related to adversarial training, for a class of 1-layer networks (which includes logistic regression models for binary and multi-class classification); for these networks we show that (a) adversarial training using an $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversary produces models with sparse attribution vectors, and (b) natural model-training while encouraging stable explanations (via an extra term in the loss function), is equivalent to adversarial training. Our second contribution is an empirical verification of phenomenon (a), which we show, somewhat surprisingly, occurs \emph{not only in 1-layer networks, but also DNNs trained on standard image datasets}, and extends beyond IG-based attributions, to those based on DeepSHAP: adversarial training with $\linf$-bounded perturbations yields significantly sparser attribution vectors, with little degradation in performance on natural test data, compared to natural training. Moreover, the sparseness of the attribution vectors is significantly better than that achievable via $\ell_1$-regularized natural training.}

They however fall short in their ability to quantify confidence in their predictions --- this is crucial in high-stakes applications that involve critical decision-making. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) aim at solving this problem by placing a prior distribution over the network's parameters, thereby inducing a posterior distribution that encapsulates predictive uncertainty. While existing variants of BNNs based on Monte Carlo dropout produce reliable (albeit approximate) uncertainty estimates over in-distribution data, they tend to exhibit over-confidence in predictions made on target data whose feature distribution differs from the training data, i.e., the covariate shift setup. In this paper, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme based on posterior regularisation, wherein unlabelled target data are used as ``pseudo-labels'' of model confidence that are used to regularise the model's loss on labelled source data. We show that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of uncertainty quantification on covariate-shifted data sets, with minimal modification to the underlying model architecture. We demonstrate the utility of our method in the context of transferring prognostic models of prostate cancer across globally diverse populations.}

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption is violated, and using existing algorithms may result in a performance lag. To proactively search for a good future policy, we present a policy gradient algorithm that maximizes a forecast of future performance. This forecast is obtained by fitting a curve to the counter-factual estimates of policy performance over time, without explicitly modeling the underlying non-stationarity. The resulting algorithm amounts to a non-uniform reweighting of past data, and we observe that minimizing performance over some of the data from past episodes can be beneficial when searching for a policy that maximizes future performance. We show that our algorithm, called Prognosticator, is more robust to non-stationarity than two online adaptation techniques, on three simulated problems motivated by real-world applications.}

To automate this process, structural engineers combine optimization methods with simulation tools to find an optimal design with minimal building mass subject to building regulations. However, structural engineers in practice often avoid optimization and compromise on a suboptimal design for the majority of buildings, due to the large size of the design space, the iterative nature of the optimization methods, and the slow simulation tools. In this work, we formulate the building structures as graphs and create an end-to-end pipeline that can learn to propose the optimal cross-sections of columns and beams by training together with a pre-trained differentiable structural simulator. The performance of the proposed structural designs is comparable to the ones optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), with all the constraints satisfied. The optimal structural design with the reduced the building mass can not only lower the material cost, but also decrease the carbon footprint.}

What makes it challenging to use a decentralized approach to collectively optimize a central objective is the difficulty in characterizing the equilibrium strategy profile of non-cooperative games. To overcome this challenge, we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each agent for which we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives. The society functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment state. We derive a class of decentralized reinforcement learning algorithms that are broadly applicable not only to standard reinforcement learning but also for selecting options in semi-MDPs and dynamically composing computation graphs. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential advantages of a society's inherent modular structure for more efficient transfer learning.}

A typical rationalization criterion, i.e. maximum mutual information (MMI), finds the rationale that maximizes the prediction performance based only on the rationale. However, MMI can be problematic because it picks up spurious correlations between the input features and the output. Instead, we introduce a game-theoretic invariant rationalization criterion where the rationales are constrained to enable the same predictor to be optimal across different environments. We show both theoretically and empirically that the proposed rationales can rule out spurious correlations and generalize better to different test scenarios. The resulting explanations also align better with human judgments. Our implementations are publicly available at https://github.com/code-terminator/invariant_rationalization.}

  abstract =   {The focus of this paper is on intrinsic methods to detect overfitting. By intrinsic methods, we mean methods that rely only on the model and the training data, as opposed to traditional methods (we call them extrinsic methods) that rely on performance on a test set or on bounds from model complexity. We propose a family of intrinsic methods called Counterfactual Simulation (CFS) which analyze the flow of training examples through the model by identifying and perturbing rare patterns. By applying CFS to logic circuits we get a method that has no hyper-parameters and works uniformly across different types of models such as neural networks, random forests and lookup tables. Experimentally, CFS can separate models with different levels of overfit using only their logic circuit representations without any access to the high level structure. By comparing lookup tables, neural networks, and random forests using CFS, we get insight into why neural networks generalize. In particular, we find that stochastic gradient descent in neural nets does not lead to "brute force" memorization, but finds common patterns (whether we train with actual or randomized labels), and neural networks are not unlike forests in this regard. Finally, we identify a limitation with our proposal that makes it unsuitable in an adversarial setting, but points the way to future work on robust intrinsic methods.}

  abstract =   {The expressivity of neural networks as a function of their depth, width and type of activation units has been an important question in deep learning theory. Recently, depth separation results for ReLU networks were obtained via a new connection with dynamical systems, using a generalized notion of fixed points of a continuous map $f$, called periodic points. In this work, we strengthen the connection with dynamical systems and we improve the existing width lower bounds along several aspects. Our first main result is period-specific width lower bounds that hold under the stronger notion of $L^1$-approximation error, instead of the weaker classification error. Our second contribution is that we provide sharper width lower bounds, still yielding meaningful exponential depth-width separations, in regimes where previous results wouldn't apply. A byproduct of our results is that there exists a universal constant characterizing the depth-width trade-offs, as long as $f$ has odd periods. Technically, our results follow by unveiling a tighter connection between the following three quantities of a given function: its period, its Lipschitz constant and the growth rate of the number of oscillations arising under compositions of the function $f$ with itself.}

In this paper, we first show through simulation that if we could select stocks via factors calculated on future fundamentals (via oracle), that our portfolios would far outperform standard factor models. Motivated by this insight, we train deep nets to forecast future fundamentals from a trailing 5-year history. We propose lookahead factor models which plug these predicted future fundamentals into traditional factors. Finally, we incorporate uncertainty estimates from both neural heteroscedastic regression and a dropout-based heuristic, improving performance by adjusting our portfolios to avert risk. In retrospective analysis, we leverage an industry-grade portfolio simulator (backtester) to show simultaneous improvement in annualized return and Sharpe ratio. Specifically, the simulated annualized return for the uncertainty-aware model is 17.7\% (vs 14.0\% for a standard factor model) and the Sharpe ratio is 0.84 (vs 0.52).}

While current state-of-the-art methods employ importance reweighting to design various biased or unbiased risk estimators, they completely ignored the learning capability of the model itself, which could provide reliable supervision. This motivates us to propose a novel Self-PU learning framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and self-training. Self-PU highlights three ``self''-oriented building blocks: a self-paced training algorithm that adaptively discovers and augments confident positive/negative examples as the training proceeds; a self-reweighted, instance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces teacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR10), which compare favorably against the latest competitors. Moreover, we study a real-world application of PU learning, i.e., classifying brain images of Alzheimer's Disease. Self-PU obtains significantly improved results on the renowned Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database over existing methods.}

While traditional algorithms have certain stopping criteria for outputting results at different iterations, many algorithm-inspired deep models are restricted to a ``fixed-depth'' for all inputs. Similar to algorithms, the optimal depth of a deep architecture may be different for different input instances, either to avoid ``over-thinking'', or because we want to compute less for operations converged already. In this paper, we tackle this varying depth problem using a steerable architecture, where a feed-forward deep model and a variational stopping policy are learned together to sequentially determine the optimal number of layers for each input instance. Training such architecture is very challenging. We provide a variational Bayes perspective and design a novel and effective training procedure which decomposes the task into an oracle model learning stage and an imitation stage. Experimentally, we show that the learned deep model along with the stopping policy improves the performances on a diverse set of tasks, including learning sparse recovery, few-shot meta learning, and computer vision tasks.}

CPE-DB is an adaptation of the original combinatorial pure exploration for multi-armed bandit (CPE-MAB) problem to the dueling bandit setting. We consider both the Borda winner and the Condorcet winner cases. For Borda winner, we establish a reduction of the problem to the original CPE-MAB setting and design PAC and exact algorithms that achieve both the sample complexity similar to that in the CPE-MAB setting (which is nearly optimal for a subclass of problems) and polynomial running time per round. For Condorcet winner, we first design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the offline problem of finding the Condorcet winner with known winning probabilities, and then use the FPTAS as an oracle to design a novel pure exploration algorithm CAR-Cond with sample complexity analysis. CAR-Cond is the first algorithm with polynomial running time per round for identifying the Condorcet winner in CPE-DB.}

Existing methods mainly focus on designing advanced attention mechanisms to simulate soft alignment, where no training signals are provided to explicitly encourage alignment. Plus, the learned attention matrices are often dense and difficult to interpret. We propose Graph Optimal Transport (GOT), a principled framework that builds upon recent advances in Optimal Transport (OT). In GOT, cross-domain alignment is formulated as a graph matching problem, by representing entities as a dynamically-constructed graph. Two types of OT distances are considered: (i) Wasserstein distance (WD) for node (entity) matching; and (ii) Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) for edge (structure) matching. Both WD and GWD can be incorporated into existing neural network models, effectively acting as a drop-in regularizer. The inferred transport plan also yields sparse and self-normalized alignment, enhancing the interpretability of the learned model. Experiments show consistent outperformance of GOT over baselines across a wide range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, image captioning, machine translation, and text summarization.}

Based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture space, DARTS learns a differentiable architecture weight and largely reduces the search cost. However, its stability has been challenged for yielding deteriorating architectures as the search proceeds. We find that the precipitous validation loss landscape, which leads to a dramatic performance drop when distilling the final architecture, is an essential factor that causes instability. Based on this observation, we propose a perturbation-based regularization - SmoothDARTS (SDARTS), to smooth the loss landscape and improve the generalizability of DARTS-based methods. In particular, our new formulations stabilize DARTS-based methods by either random smoothing or adversarial attack. The search trajectory on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and due to the improved stability, we achieve performance gain across various search spaces on 4 datasets. Furthermore, we mathematically show that SDARTS implicitly regularizes the Hessian norm of the validation loss, which accounts for a smoother loss landscape and improved performance.}

However, most general neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural information, limiting their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural representation, Tensor Product Representations (TPRs), for mapping Natural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called TP-N2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR `binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR `unbinding' to generate, in symbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and creates new state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies show that improvements can be attributed to the use of structured TPRs explicitly in both the encoder and decoder. Analysis of the learned structures shows how TPRs enhance the interpretability of TP-N2F.}

We propose an extension to the framework of variational auto-encoders allows learning flat latent manifolds, where the Euclidean metric is a proxy for the similarity between data points. This is achieved by defining the latent space as a Riemannian manifold and by regularising the metric tensor to be a scaled identity matrix. Additionally, we replace the compact prior typically used in variational auto-encoders with a recently presented, more expressive hierarchical one---and formulate the learning problem as a constrained optimisation problem. We evaluate our method on a range of data-sets, including a video-tracking benchmark, where the performance of our unsupervised approach nears that of state-of-the-art supervised approaches, while retaining the computational efficiency of straight-line-based approaches.}

We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.}

In this paper, we propose Retro*, a neural-based A*-like algorithm that finds high-quality synthetic routes efficiently. It maintains the search as an AND-OR tree, and learns a neural search bias with off-policy data. Then guided by this neural network, it performs best-first search efficiently during new planning episodes.

They tend to be overconfident, with the model confidence not always reflecting the underlying true ambiguity and hardness. In this paper, we propose angular visual hardness (AVH), a score given by the normalized angular distance between the sample feature embedding and the target classifier to measure sample hardness. We validate this score with an in-depth and extensive scientific study, and observe that CNN models with the highest accuracy also have the best AVH scores. This agrees with an earlier finding that state-of-art models improve on the classification of harder examples. We observe that the training dynamics of AVH is vastly different compared to the training loss. Specifically, AVH quickly reaches a plateau for all samples even though the training loss keeps improving. This suggests the need for designing better loss functions that can target harder examples more effectively. We also find that AVH has a statistically significant correlation with human visual hardness. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of AVH to a variety of applications such as self-training for domain adaptation and domain generalization.}

  abstract =   {Randomized Newton methods have recently become the focus of intense research activity in large-scale and distributed optimization. In general, these methods are based on a ``computation-accuracy trade-off'', which allows the user to gain scalability in exchange for error in the solution. However, the user does not know how much error is created by the randomized approximation, which can be detrimental in two ways: On one hand, the user may try to assess the unknown error with theoretical worst-case error bounds, but this approach is impractical when the bounds involve unknown constants, and it often leads to excessive computation. On the other hand, the user may select the ``sketch size'' and stopping criteria in a heuristic manner, but this can lead to unreliable results. Motivated by these difficulties, we show how bootstrapping can be used to directly estimate the unknown error, which prevents excessive computation, and offers more confidence about the quality of a randomized solution.}

However, tractability imposes architectural constraints on generative flows. In this work, we study a previously overlooked constraint that all the intermediate representations must have the same dimensionality with the data due to invertibility, limiting the width of the network. We propose VFlow to tackle this constraint on dimensionality. VFlow augments the data with extra dimensions and defines a maximum evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective for estimating the distribution of augmented data jointly with the variational data augmentation distribution. Under mild assumptions, we show that the maximum ELBO solution of VFlow is always better than the original maximum likelihood solution. For image density modeling on the CIFAR-10 dataset, VFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension.}

  abstract =   {Despite remarkable success in practice, modern machine learning models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that make human-imperceptible perturbations to the data, but result in serious and potentially dangerous prediction errors. To address this issue, practitioners often use adversarial training to learn models that are robust against such attacks at the cost of higher generalization error on unperturbed test sets. The conventional wisdom is that more training data should shrink the gap between the generalization error of adversarially-trained models and standard models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers for both Gaussian and Bernoulli models under $\ell_\infty$ attacks, and we prove that more data may actually increase this gap. Furthermore, our theoretical results identify if and when additional data will finally begin to shrink the gap. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that our results also hold for linear regression models, which may indicate that this phenomenon occurs more broadly.}

Algorithms that use acceleration in such a setting are prone to instabilities, making it difficult to reach convergence. In this work, we exploit the finite-sum structure of the objective in order to design a variance-reduced DFO algorithm that provably yields acceleration. We prove rates of convergence for both smooth convex and strongly-convex finite-sum objective functions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on several tasks and datasets.}

Previous results showed that we cannot obtain a constant approximation ratio for the maximum coverage problem using polynomially many independent samples of the form $\{S_i, f(S_i)\}_{i=1}^t$ (Balkanski et al., 2017), even if coverage functions are $(1 - \epsilon)$-PMAC learnable using these samples (Badanidiyuru et al., 2012), which means most of the function values can be approximately learned very well with high probability. In this work, to circumvent the impossibility result of OPS, we propose a stronger model called optimization from structured samples (OPSS) for coverage functions, where the data samples encode the structural information of the functions. We show that under three general assumptions on the sample distributions, we can design efficient OPSS algorithms that achieve a constant approximation for the maximum coverage problem. We further prove a constant lower bound under these assumptions, which is tight when not considering computational efficiency. Moreover, we also show that if we remove any one of the three assumptions, OPSS for the maximum coverage problem has no constant approximation.}

These defenses often predict by inverting the deep generative models rather than simple feedforward propagation. Such defenses are difficult to attack due to the obfuscated gradients caused by inversion. In this work, we propose a new white-box attack to break these defenses. The idea is to view the inversion phase as a dynamical system, through which we extract the gradient w.r.t the image by backtracking its trajectory. An amortized strategy is also developed to accelerate the attack. Experiments show that our attack better breaks state-of-the-art defenses (e.g DefenseGAN, ABS) than other attacks (e.g BPDA). Additionally, our empirical results provide insights for understanding the weaknesses of deep generative model defenses.}

Yet the role of ImageNet knowledge is seldom discussed despite common practices that leverage this knowledge to maintain the generalization ability. An example is the careful hand-tuning of early stopping and layer-wise learning rates, which is shown to improve synthetic-to-real generalization but is also laborious and heuristic. In this work, we explicitly encourage the synthetically trained model to maintain similar representations with the ImageNet pretrained model, and propose a \emph{learning-to-optimize (L2O)} strategy to automate the selection of layer-wise learning rates. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the synthetic-to-real generalization performance without seeing and training on real data, while also benefiting downstream tasks such as domain adaptation.

Since the server receives more information from users in CSB, it usually causes additional dependence on the dimension of data, which is a notorious side-effect for privacy preserving learning. However for CSB under two common smoothness assumptions, we show it is possible to remove this side-effect. In detail, for $B_{\infty}$-bounded smooth CSB under either $\varepsilon$-LDP or $\varepsilon$-DP, we prove the optimal regret bound is $\Theta(\frac{mB^2_{\infty}\ln T } {\Delta\varepsilon^2})$ or $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{mB^2_{\infty}\ln T} { \Delta\varepsilon})$ respectively, where $T$ is time period, $\Delta$ is the gap of rewards and $m$ is the number of base arms, by proposing novel algorithms and matching lower bounds. For $B_1$-bounded smooth CSB under $\varepsilon$-DP, we also prove the optimal regret bound is $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{mKB^2_1\ln T} {\Delta\varepsilon})$ with both upper bound and lower bound, where $K$ is the maximum number of feedback in each round. All above results nearly match corresponding non-private optimal rates, which imply there is no additional price for (locally) differentially private CSB in above common settings.}

Our approach leverages a novel structural lemma, roughly showing that any approximate stationary point of our non-convex objective gives a near-optimal solution to the underlying robust estimation task. Our work establishes an intriguing connection between algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and non-convex optimization, which may have broader applications to other robust estimation tasks.}

Specifically, we introduce the concept of distilled examples, i.e. examples whose labels are identical with the labels assigned for them by the Bayes optimal classifier, and prove that under certain conditions classifiers learnt on distilled examples will converge to the Bayes optimal classifier. Inspired by the idea of learning with distilled examples, we then propose a learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees for its robustness to BILN. At last, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show effectiveness of our algorithm in learning with BILN.}

In this article, we study a new paradigm called mutual transfer learning where among many heterogeneous data domains, every data domain could potentially be the target of interest, and it could also be a useful source to help the learning in other data domains. However, it is important to note that given a target not every data domain can be a successful source; only data sets that are similar enough to be thought as from the same population can be useful sources for each other. Under this mutual learnability assumption, a confidence distribution fusion approach is proposed to recover the mutual learnability relation in the transfer learning regime. Our proposed method achieves the same oracle statistical inferential accuracy as if the true learnability structure were known. It can be implemented in an efficient parallel fashion to deal with large-scale data. Simulated and real examples are analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.}

To maximize extraction of such informative cues from the data, we set the problem within the context of contrastive representation learning and to that end propose a novel objective via optimal transport. Specifically, our formulation seeks a low-dimensional subspace representation of the data that jointly (i) maximizes the distance of the data (embedded in this subspace) from an adversarial data distribution under the optimal transport, a.k.a. the Wasserstein distance, (ii) captures the temporal order, and (iii) minimizes the data distortion. To generate the adversarial distribution, we propose a novel framework connecting Wasserstein GANs with a classifier, allowing a principled mechanism for producing good negative distributions for contrastive learning, which is currently a challenging problem. Our full objective is cast as a subspace learning problem on the Grassmann manifold and solved via Riemannian optimization. To empirically study our formulation, we provide experiments on the task of human action recognition in video sequences. Our results demonstrate competitive performance against challenging baselines.}

  abstract =   {We study the effect of norm based regularization on the size of coresets for regression problems. Specifically, given a matrix $ \mathbf{A} \in {\mathbb{R}}^{n \times d}$ with $n\gg d$ and a vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R} ^ n $ and $\lambda > 0$, we analyze the size of coresets for regularized versions of regression of the form $\|\mathbf{Ax}-\mathbf{b}\|_p^r + \lambda\|{\mathbf{x}}\|_q^s$. Prior work has shown that for ridge regression (where $p,q,r,s=2$) we can obtain a coreset that is smaller than the coreset for the unregularized counterpart i.e. least squares regression~\cite{avron2017sharper}. We show that when $r \neq s$, no coreset for regularized regression can have size smaller than the optimal coreset of the unregularized version. The well known lasso problem falls under this category and hence does not allow a coreset smaller than the one for least squares regression. We propose a modified version of the lasso problem and obtain for it a coreset of size smaller than the least square regression. We empirically show that the modified version of lasso also induces sparsity in solution, similar to the original lasso. We also obtain smaller coresets for $\ell_p$ regression with $\ell_p$ regularization. We extend our methods to multi response regularized regression. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the coreset performance for the modified lasso and the $\ell_1$ regression with $\ell_1$ regularization.}

In this work, we design new streaming and distributed algorithms for the fair k-center problem that models fair data summarization. The streaming and distributed models of computation have an attractive feature of being able to handle massive data sets that do not fit into main memory. Our main contributions are: (a) the first distributed algorithm; which has provably constant approximation ratio and is extremely parallelizable, and (b) a two-pass streaming algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee matching the best known algorithm (which is not a streaming algorithm). Our algorithms have the advantages of being easy to implement in practice, being fast with linear running times, having very small working memory and communication, and outperforming existing algorithms on several real and synthetic data sets. To complement our distributed algorithm, we also give a hardness result for natural distributed algorithms, which holds for even the special case of k-center.}

We present a weakly supervised algorithm for overcoming dataset bias for deep generative models. Our approach requires access to an additional small, unlabeled reference dataset as the supervision signal, thus sidestepping the need for explicit labels on the underlying bias factors. Using this supplementary dataset, we detect the bias in existing datasets via a density ratio technique and learn generative models which efficiently achieve the twin goals of: 1) data efficiency by using training examples from both biased and reference datasets for learning; and 2) data generation close in distribution to the reference dataset at test time. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach which reduces bias w.r.t. latent factors by an average of up to 34.6\% over baselines for comparable image generation using generative adversarial networks.}

Nevertheless, UREs lead to overfitting in many problem settings when the models are complex like deep networks. In this paper, we investigate reasons for such overfitting by studying a weakly supervised problem called learning with complementary labels. We argue the quality of gradient estimation matters more in risk minimization. Theoretically, we show that a URE gives an unbiased gradient estimator(UGE). Practically, however, UGEs may suffer from huge variance, which causes empirical gradients to be usually far away from true gradients during minimization. To this end, we propose a novel surrogate complementary loss(SCL) framework that trades zero bias with reduced variance and makes empirical gradients more aligned with true gradients in the direction. Thanks to this characteristic, SCL successfully mitigates the overfitting issue and improves URE-based methods.}

Unfortunately, the majority of relevant work embraces the implicit assumption that the distribution of observed data is perfectly balanced, despite the fact that, in the real world, humans and animals learn from observations that are temporally correlated and severely imbalanced. Motivated by this remark, we aim to evaluate memory population methods that are used in online continual learning, when dealing with highly imbalanced and temporally correlated streams of data. More importantly, we introduce a new memory population approach, which we call class-balancing reservoir sampling (CBRS). We demonstrate that CBRS outperforms the state-of-the-art memory population algorithms in a considerably challenging learning setting, over a range of different datasets, and for multiple architectures.}

The recent success of DNNs motivates many DML losses that encourage the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The trade-off between inter-class compactness and inter-class separability shapes the DML representation space by determining how much information of the original inputs to retain. In this paper, we propose a Distance Metric Learning with Joint Representation Diversification (JRD) that allows a better balancing point between intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Specifically, we propose a Joint Representation Similarity regularizer that captures different abstract levels of invariant features and diversifies the joint distributions of representations across multiple layers. Experiments on three deep DML benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for Euclidean projection onto $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm ball. We tackle the projection problem via semismooth Newton algorithm to solve the system of semismooth equations. Meanwhile, exploiting the structure of the Jacobian matrix via LU decomposition yields an equivalent algorithm which is proved to terminate after a finite number of iterations.

To do so, we use a set of domain-invariant predictors as a proxy for the unknown, true target labels. Since the error of the resulting risk estimate depends on the target risk of the proxy model, we study generalization of domain-invariant representations and show that the complexity of the latent representation has a significant influence on the target risk. Empirically, our approach (1) enables self-tuning of domain adaptation models, and (2) accurately estimates the target error of given models under distribution shift. Other applications include model selection, deciding early stopping and error detection.}

We propose a new Bayesian comparison-based search algorithm with noisy answers; it has low computational complexity yet is efficient in the number of queries. We provide theoretical guarantees, deriving the form of the optimal query and proving almost sure convergence to the target t. Second, we consider the blind setting, where the object features are hidden from the search algorithm. In this setting, we combine our search method and a new distributional triplet embedding algorithm into one scalable learning framework called Learn2Search. We show that the query complexity of our approach on two real-world datasets is on par with the non-blind setting, which is not achievable using any of the current state-of-the-art embedding methods.

Thus in this paper, we propose an online knowledge distillation method that transfers not only the knowledge of the class probabilities but also that of the feature map using the adversarial training framework. We train multiple networks simultaneously by employing discriminators to distinguish the feature map distributions of different networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator which discriminates the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that of the other network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator, it can learn the other network's feature map distribution. We show that our method performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1 and is more suitable for online distillation. Also, we propose a novel cyclic learning scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied our method to various network architectures on the classification task and discovered a significant improvement of performance especially in the case of training a pair of a small network and a large one.}

We also consider weaker black box learners, where, in each round, the choice of the consistent hypothesis returned to the Teacher is not adversarial, and in particular, we show that better provable bounds can be obtained for a type of Learner that moves to the next hypothesis smoothly, preferring hypotheses that are close to the current one; and for another type of Learner that can provide to the Teacher hypotheses chosen at random among those consistent with the examples received so far.

Such structures are now central components of large-scale data analytics and machine learning pipelines. However, many common functions, such as thresholds and $p$th frequency moments with $p>2$, are known to require polynomial size sketches in the worst case. We explore performance beyond the worst case under two different types of assumptions. The first is having access to noisy \emph{advice} on item frequencies. This continues the line of work of Hsu et al. (ICLR 2019), who assume predictions are provided by a machine learning model. The second is providing guaranteed performance on a restricted class of input frequency distributions that are better aligned with what is observed in practice. This extends the work on heavy hitters under Zipfian distributions in a seminal paper of Charikar et al. (ICALP 2002). Surprisingly, we show analytically and empirically that "in practice" small polylogarithmic-size sketches provide accuracy for "hard" functions.}

By calibrating predictions via a tempered softmax weighting, we provide a solution to these problems for multiple product-of-expert models, including the generalised product of experts and the robust Bayesian committee machine. Furthermore, we leverage the optimal transport literature and propose a new product-of-expert model that combines predictions of local experts by computing their Wasserstein barycenter, which can be applied to both regression and classification.}

  abstract =   {A classic problem in unsupervised learning and data analysis is to find simpler and easy-to-visualize representations of the data that preserve its essential properties. A widely-used method to preserve the underlying hierarchical structure of the data while reducing its complexity is to find an embedding of the data into a tree or an ultrametric, but computing such an embedding on a data set of $n$ points in $\Omega(\log n)$ dimensions incurs a quite prohibitive running time of $\Theta(n^2)$. In this paper, we provide a new algorithm which takes as input a set of points $P$ in $\R^d$, and for every $c\ge 1$, runs in time $n^{1+\frac{\rho}{c^2}}$ (for some universal constant $\rho>1$) to output an ultrametric $\Delta$ such that for any two points $u,v$ in $P$, we have $\Delta(u,v)$ is within a multiplicative factor of $5c$ to the distance between $u$ and $v$ in the best ultrametric representation of $P$. Here, the best ultrametric is the ultrametric $\tilde\Delta$ that minimizes the maximum distance distortion with respect to the $\ell_2$ distance, namely that minimizes $\underset{u,v \in P}{\max}\ \nicefrac{\tilde\Delta(u,v)}{\|u-v\|_2}$. We complement the above result by showing that under popular complexity theoretic assumptions, for every constant $\varepsilon>0$, no algorithm with running time $n^{2-\varepsilon}$ can distinguish between inputs in $\ell_\infty$-metric that admit isometric embedding and those that incur a distortion of $\nicefrac{3}{2}$. Finally, we present empirical evaluation on classic machine learning datasets and show that the output of our algorithm is comparable to the output of the linkage algorithms while achieving a much faster running time.}

This sketch can correctly report the nearest neighbors of any query that satisfies a stability condition parameterized by $b$. We achieve sublinear memory performance on stable queries by combining recent advances in locality sensitive hash (LSH)-based estimators, online kernel density estimation, and compressed sensing. Our theoretical results shed new light on the memory-accuracy tradeoff for nearest neighbor search, and our sketch, which consists entirely of short integer arrays, has a variety of attractive features in practice. We evaluate the memory-recall tradeoff of our method on a friend recommendation task in the Google plus social media network. We obtain orders of magnitude better compression than the random projection based alternative while retaining the ability to report the nearest neighbors of practical queries.}

This subroutine chases the negative gradient direction in a matching pursuit-style while still preserving the projection-free property. Although the approach is reasonably natural, it produces very significant results. We derive convergence rates $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\omega t})$ of our method and we demonstrate its competitive advantage both per iteration and in CPU time over the state-of-the-art in a series of computational experiments.}

To address this, we propose continuously indexed flows (CIFs), which replace the single bijection used by normalising flows with a continuously indexed family of bijections, and which can intuitively "clean up" mass that would otherwise be misplaced by a single bijection.

The transformations induced by such maps enable us to span a larger class of signal representations, from wavelet to chirplet-like filters. We propose a parameterization of such a non-linear map such that its sampling can be optimized for a specific task and signal. The Learnable Group Transform can be cast into a Deep Neural Network. The experiments on diverse time-series datasets demonstrate the expressivity of this framework, which competes with state-of-the-art performances.}

We show that this formulation affords several new directions of inquiry to the modeler, where sound causal assumptions can be expressed and manipulated.

Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to over 50 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than $10\%$, identifying several broken defenses.}

The core problem of long-range planning is finding an efficient way to search through the tree of possible action sequences. Existing non-learned planning solutions from the Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) literature rely on the existence of logical descriptions for the effects and preconditions for actions. This constraint allows TAMP methods to efficiently reduce the tree search problem but limits their ability to generalize to unseen and complex physical environments. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods use flexible neural-network-based function approximators to discover policies that generalize naturally to unseen circumstances. However, DRL methods struggle to handle the very sparse reward landscapes inherent to long-range multi-step planning situations. Here, we propose the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), which fuses elements of TAMP and DRL by combining a curiosity-guided sampling strategy with imitation learning to accelerate planning. We show that CSP can efficiently discover interesting and complex temporally-extended plans for solving a wide range of physically realistic 3D tasks. In contrast, standard planning and learning methods often fail to solve these tasks at all or do so only with a huge and highly variable number of training samples. We explore the use of a variety of curiosity metrics with CSP and analyze the types of solutions that CSP discovers. Finally, we show that CSP supports task transfer so that the exploration policies learned during experience with one task can help improve efficiency on related tasks.}

To be robust to outliers and differences in scale across features, a matrix factorization step is usually preceded by ad-hoc feature normalization steps, such as tf-idf scaling or data whitening. We propose in this work to learn these normalization operators jointly with the factorization itself. More precisely, given a $d\times n$ matrix $X$ of $d$ features measured on $n$ individuals, we propose to learn the parameters of quantile normalization operators that can operate row-wise on the values of $X$ and/or of its factorization $UV$ to improve the quality of the low-rank representation of $X$ itself. This optimization is facilitated by the introduction of a new differentiable quantile normalization operator built using optimal transport, providing new results on top of existing work by Cuturi et al. (2019). We demonstrate the applicability of these techniques on synthetic and genomics datasets.}

  abstract =   {Deep neural networks can achieve remarkable generalization performances while interpolating the training data. Rather than the U-curve emblematic of the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a "double descent"---a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work, we develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy learning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a high-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise asymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error, and show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation threshold, beyond it which it remains constant. We disentangle the variances stemming from the sampling of the dataset, from the additive noise corrupting the labels, and from the initialization of the weights. We demonstrate that the latter two contributions are the crux of the double descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation threshold and to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We quantify how they are suppressed by ensembling the outputs of $K$ independently initialized estimators. For $K\rightarrow \infty$, the test error is monotonously decreasing and remains constant beyond the interpolation threshold. We further compare the effects of overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing. Finally, we present numerical experiments on classic deep learning setups to show that our results hold qualitatively in realistic lazy learning scenarios.}

  abstract =   {This paper presents a recursive reasoning formalism of Bayesian optimization (BO) to model the reasoning process in the interactions between boundedly rational, self-interested agents with unknown, complex, and costly-to-evaluate payoff functions in repeated games, which we call Recursive Reasoning-Based BO (R2-B2). Our R2-B2 algorithm is general in that it does not constrain the relationship among the payoff functions of different agents and can thus be applied to various types of games such as constant-sum, general-sum, and common-payoff games. We prove that by reasoning at level 2 or more and at one level higher than the other agents, our R2-B2 agent can achieve faster asymptotic convergence to no regret than that without utilizing recursive reasoning. We also propose a computationally cheaper variant of R2-B2 called R2-B2-Lite at the expense of a weaker convergence guarantee. The performance and generality of our R2-B2 algorithm are empirically demonstrated using synthetic games, adversarial machine learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.}

  abstract =   {Learning graph generative models is a challenging task for deep learning and has wide applicability to a range of domains like chemistry, biology and social science. However current deep neural methods suffer from limited scalability: for a graph with n nodes and m edges, existing deep neural methods require Omega(n^2) complexity by building up the adjacency matrix. On the other hand, many real world graphs are actually sparse in the sense that m << n^2. Based on this, we develop a novel autoregressive model, named BiGG, that utilizes this sparsity to avoid generating the full adjacency matrix, and importantly reduces the graph generation time complexity to O((n + m) log n). Furthermore, during training this autoregressive model can be parallelized with O(log n) synchronization stages, which makes it much more efficient than other autoregressive models that require Omega(n). Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed approach not only scales to orders of magnitude larger graphs than previously possible with deep autoregressive graph generative models, but also yields better graph generation quality.}

Even so, it is well known that poor solutions whereby the latent posterior collapses to an uninformative prior are sometimes obtained in practice. However, contrary to conventional wisdom that largely assigns blame for this phenomena on the undue influence of KL-divergence regularization, we will argue that posterior collapse is, at least in part, a direct consequence of bad local minima inherent to the loss surface of deep autoencoder networks. In particular, we prove that even small nonlinear perturbations of affine VAE decoder models can produce such minima, and in deeper models, analogous minima can force the VAE to behave like an aggressive truncation operator, provably discarding information along all latent dimensions in certain circumstances. Regardless, the underlying message here is not meant to undercut valuable existing explanations of posterior collapse, but rather, to refine the discussion and elucidate alternative risk factors that may have been previously underappreciated.}

A key question is whether one can still construct hypothesis tests and conﬁdence sets with proper coverage and high power in a so-called likelihood-free inference (LFI) setting; that is, a setting where the likelihood is not explicitly known but one can forward-simulate observable data according to a stochastic model. In this paper, we present ACORE (Approximate Computation via Odds Ratio Estimation), a frequentist approach to LFI that ﬁrst formulates the classical likelihood ratio test (LRT) as a parametrized classiﬁcation problem, and then uses the equivalence of tests and conﬁdence sets to build conﬁdence regions for parameters of interest. We also present a goodness-of-ﬁt procedure for checking whether the constructed tests and conﬁdence regions are valid. ACORE is based on the key observation that the LRT statistic, the rejection probability of the test, and the coverage of the conﬁdence set are conditional distribution functions which often vary smoothly as a function of the parameters of interest. Hence, instead of relying solely on samples simulated at ﬁxed parameter settings (as is the convention in standard Monte Carlo solutions), one can leverage machine learning tools and data simulated in the neighborhood of a parameter to improve estimates of quantities of interest. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of ACORE with both theoretical and empirical results. Our implementation is available on Github.}

In this paper we consider the goodness-of-fit testing problem for large inhomogeneous random (IER) graphs, where given a (known) reference symmetric matrix $Q \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$ and $m$ independent samples from an IER graph given by an unknown symmetric matrix $P \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$, the goal is to test the hypothesis $P=Q$ versus $||P-Q|| \geq \varepsilon$, where $||\cdot||$ is some specified norm on symmetric matrices. Building on recent related work on two-sample testing for IER graphs, we derive the optimal minimax sample complexities for the goodness-of-fit problem in various natural norms, such as the Frobenius norm and the operator norm. We also propose practical implementations of natural test statistics, using their asymptotic distributions and through the parametric bootstrap. We compare the performances of the different tests in simulations, and show that the proposed tests outperform the baseline tests across various natural random graphs models.}

The results are stated in terms of the \emph{Adversarial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (AdvSNR)}, which generalizes a similar notion for standard linear classification to the adversarial setting. For the Gaussian mixtures with AdvSNR value of $r$, we prove an excess risk lower bound of order $\Theta(e^{-(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)) r^2} \frac{d}{n})$ and design a computationally efficient estimator that achieves this optimal rate.

This flexible family of problems connects standard, unsupervised subspace fitting that enforces strict orthonormality with a corresponding regression task that is fully supervised and does not constrain the linear operator structure. This class of problems is defined over a supervision-orthonormality plane, where each coordinate induces a problem instance with a unique pair of supervision level and softness of orthonormality constraints. We explore this plane and show that the generalization errors of the corresponding subspace fitting problems follow double descent trends as the settings become more supervised and less orthonormally constrained.}

We propose question-answering as a general paradigm to decode and understand the representations that such agents develop, applying our method to two recent approaches to predictive modelling - action-conditional CPC (Guo et al., 2018) and SimCore (Gregor et al., 2019). After training agents with these predictive objectives in a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of objects, colors, shapes, and spatial configurations, we probe their internal state representations with a host of synthetic (English) questions, without backpropagating gradients from the question-answering decoder into the agent. The performance of different agents when probed in this way reveals that they learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information about objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment. Our approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret the responses of the model as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e. applicable to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of objects, quantities, properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn, question-conditional agent probing can stimulate the design and development of stronger predictive learning objectives.}

Alternatively, sampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization walk one or more trajectories through the tree, touching only a fraction of the nodes on each iteration, at the expense of requiring more iterations to converge due to the variance of sampled values. In this paper, we extend recent work that uses baseline estimates to reduce this variance. We introduce a framework of baseline-corrected values in EFGs that generalizes the previous work. Within our framework, we propose new baseline functions that result in significantly reduced variance compared to existing techniques. We show that one particular choice of such a function --- predictive baseline --- is provably optimal under certain sampling schemes. This allows for efficient computation of zero-variance value estimates even along sampled trajectories.}

We identify subsets of edges, named ``configurations'', such that adding noise to all edges in such a subset guarantees differential privacy of the end-to-end spectral algorithm. We characterize the sensitivity of the edges with respect to the input and thus estimate the amount of noise to be added to each edge for any required privacy level. We then characterize the utility loss for each configuration as a function of injected noise. Overall, by combining the sensitivity and utility characterization, we obtain an end-to-end differentially private spectral algorithm for LDA and identify which configurations outperform others under specific regimes. We are the first to achieve utility guarantees under a required level of differential privacy for learning in LDA. We additionally show that our method systematically outperforms differentially private variational inference.}

Second, we design the first asymptotically optimal algorithm for fixed-confidence pure exploration in linear bandits.

However, in many applications Gaussian processes can struggle with even moderate input dimensionality. Learning a low dimensional projection can help alleviate this curse of dimensionality, but introduces many trainable hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome, especially in the small data regime. We use additive sums of kernels for GP regression, where each kernel operates on a different random projection of its inputs. Surprisingly, we find that as the number of random projections increases, the predictive performance of this approach quickly converges to the performance of a kernel operating on the original full dimensional inputs, over a wide range of data sets, even if we are projecting into a single dimension. As a consequence, many problems can remarkably be reduced to one dimensional input spaces, without learning a transformation. We prove this convergence and its rate, and additionally propose a deterministic approach that converges more quickly than purely random projections. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach can achieve faster inference and improved predictive accuracy for high-dimensional inputs compared to kernels in the original input space.}

The proposed AIF enjoys a closed-form and can be calculated efficiently. To illustrate the usage of AIF, we apply it to study model sensitivity --- a quantity defined to capture the change of prediction losses on the natural data after implementing robust optimization. We use AIF to analyze how model complexity and randomized smoothing affect the model sensitivity with respect to specific models. We further derive AIF for kernel regressions, with a particular application to neural tangent kernels, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AIF. Lastly, the theories of AIF will be extended to distributional robust optimization.}

However, such a method requires the evaluation of the energy function based on the full dataset and is not scalable to big data. The na\"ive implementation of reMC in mini-batch settings introduces large biases, which cannot be directly extended to the stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC), the standard sampling method for simulating from deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive replica exchange SGMCMC (reSGMCMC) to automatically correct the bias and study the corresponding properties. The analysis implies an acceleration-accuracy trade-off in the numerical discretization of a Markov jump process in a stochastic environment. Empirically, we test the algorithm through extensive experiments on various setups and obtain the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN in both supervised learning and semi-supervised learning tasks.}

Specifically, we investigate the non-concave landscape of the adversaries for a two-layer neural network with a quadratic loss. Our main result proves that projected gradient ascent finds a local maximum of this non-concave problem in a polynomial number of iterations with high probability. To our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a convergence analysis of the first-order adversaries. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that, in the initial phase of adversarial training, the scale of the inputs matters in the sense that a smaller input scale leads to faster convergence of adversarial training and a ``more regular'' landscape. Finally, we show that these theoretical findings are in excellent agreement with a series of experiments.}

  abstract =   {Motivated by the repeated sale of online ads via auctions, optimal pricing in repeated auctions has attracted a large body of research. While dynamic mechanisms offer powerful techniques to improve on both revenue and efficiency by optimizing auctions across different items, their reliance on exact distributional information of buyers' valuations (present and future) limits their use in practice. In this paper, we propose robust dynamic mechanism design. We develop a new framework to design dynamic mechanisms that are robust to both estimation errors in value distributions and strategic behavior. We apply the framework in learning environments, leading to the first policy that achieves provably low regret against the optimal dynamic mechanism in contextual auctions, where the dynamic benchmark has full and accurate distributional information.}

However, the underlying optimization problem is known to have two major restrictions: (i) it largely depends on the choice of the cost function and (ii) its sample complexity scales exponentially with the dimension. In this paper, we propose a general formulation of a minimax OT problem that can tackle these restrictions by jointly optimizing the cost matrix and the transport plan, allowing us to define a robust distance between distributions. We propose to use a cutting-set method to solve this general problem and show its links and advantages compared to other existing minimax OT approaches. Additionally, we use this method to define a notion of stability allowing us to select the most robust cost matrix. Finally, we provide an experimental study highlighting the efficiency of our approach.}

The bound also highlights the benefit of a large margin separation on the source domain for adaptation and introduces an optimal transport (OT) based distance between domains that has the virtue of being task-dependent, contrary to other approaches. From the obtained theoretical results, we derive a novel algorithmic solution for domain adaptation that introduces a novel shallow OT-based adversarial approach and outperforms other OT-based DA baselines on several simulated and real-world classification tasks.}

In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model of much lower complexity such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance. Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel. Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method. The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases. In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance. We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works. Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model.}

The spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm has a novel ingredient: it computes a few eigenvectors of the gradient and solves a small-scale subproblem in each iteration. Such a procedure overcomes the slow convergence of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm due to ignoring eigenvalue coalescence. We demonstrate that strict complementarity of the optimization problem is key to proving linear convergence of various algorithms, such as the spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm as well as the projected gradient method and its accelerated version. We showcase that the strict complementarity is equivalent to the eigengap assumption on the gradient at the optimal solution considered in the literature. As a byproduct of this observation, we also develop a generalized block Frank-Wolfe algorithm and prove its linear convergence.}

This procedure results in a kernel expansion with respect to entropic optimal features (EOF), improving the data representation dramatically due to features dissimilarity. Under mild technical assumptions, our generalization bound shows that with only $O(N^{\frac{1}{4}})$ features (disregarding logarithmic factors), we can achieve the optimal statistical accuracy (i.e., $O(1/\sqrt{N})$). The salient feature of our design is its sparsity that significantly reduces the time and space costs. Our numerical experiments on benchmark datasets verify the superiority of EOF over the state-of-the-art in kernel approximation.}

AMM is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with training time comparable to linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and significantly higher accuracy. On the other hand, empirical results indicate there is a large accuracy gap between AMM and non-linear SVMs. In this paper we show that this performance gap is not due to limited representability of the MM model, as it can represent arbitrary concepts. We set to explain the connection between the AMM and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithms, and introduce a novel Growing AMM (GAMM) classifier motivated by Growing LVQ, that imputes duplicate hyperplanes into the MM model during SGD training. We provide theoretical results showing that GAMM has favorable convergence properties, and analyze the generalization bound of the MM models. Experiments indicate that GAMM achieves significantly improved accuracy on non-linear problems, with only slightly slower training compared to AMM. On some tasks GAMM comes close to non-linear SVM, and outperforms other popular classifiers such as Neural Networks and Random Forests.}

The key proof idea is to describe gradients in a certain inner-product space, thus permitting the use of Bessel's inequality.

We consider precise composition bounds of the overall privacy loss for exponential mechanisms, one of the fundamental classes of mechanisms in DP. Exponential mechanism has also become a fundamental building block in private machine learning, e.g. private PCA and hyper-parameter selection. We give explicit formulations of the optimal privacy loss for both the adaptive and non-adaptive composition of exponential mechanism. For the non-adaptive setting in which each mechanism has the same privacy parameter, we give an efficiently computable formulation of the optimal privacy loss. In the adaptive case, we derive a recursive formula and an efficiently computable upper bound. These precise understandings about the problem lead to a 40\% saving of the privacy budget in a practical application. Furthermore, the algorithm-specific analysis shows a difference in privacy parameters of adaptive and non-adaptive composition, which was widely believed to not exist based on the evidence from general analysis.}

Illuminated by our analyses, we move towards theoretically sound growing operations and schedulers, giving rise to an adaptive training algorithm for residual networks, LipGrow, which automatically increases network depth thus accelerates training. In our experiments, it achieves comparable performance while reducing ∼ 50\% of training time.}

For these MDPs, model-based planning is a favorable algorithm, because the resulting policies can approximate the optimal policy significantly better than a neural network parameterization can, and model-free or model-based policy optimization rely on policy parameterization. Motivated by the theory, we apply a simple multi-step model-based bootstrapping planner (BOOTS) to bootstrap a weak Q-function into a stronger policy. Empirical results show that applying BOOTS on top of model-based or model-free policy optimization algorithms at the test time improves the performance on benchmark tasks.}

NGBoost generalizes gradient boosting to probabilistic regression by treating the parameters of the conditional distribution as targets for a multiparameter boosting algorithm.

We consider a regression-based fitted Q-iteration method, show that it is equivalent to a model-based method that estimates a conditional mean embedding of the transition operator, and prove that this method is information-theoretically optimal and has nearly minimal estimation error. In particular, by leveraging contraction property of Markov processes and martingale concentration, we establish a finite-sample instance-dependent error upper bound and a nearly-matching minimax lower bound. The policy evaluation error depends sharply on a restricted $\chi^2$-divergence over the function class between the long-term distribution of target policy and the distribution of past data. This restricted $\chi^2$-divergence characterizes the statistical limit of off-policy evaluation and is both instance-dependent and function-class-dependent. Further, we provide an easily computable confidence bound for the policy evaluator, which may be useful for optimistic planning and safe policy improvement.}

  abstract =   {In this paper, we present a Bayesian Moment Matching (BMM) based method aimed at solving the initialization problem in Boolean SAT solvers. The initialization problem can be stated as follows: given a SAT formula $\phi$, compute an initial order over the variables of $\phi$ and values/polarity for these variables such that the runtime of SAT solvers on input $\phi$ is minimized. At the start of a solver run, our BMM-based methods compute a posterior probability distribution for an assignment to the variables of the input formula after analyzing its clauses, which will then be used by the solver to initialize its search. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our BMM-based heuristic against 4 other initialization methods (random, survey propagation, Jeroslow-Wang, and default) in state-of-the-art solvers, MapleCOMSPS and MapleLCMDistChronotBT over the SAT competition 2018 application benchmark, as well as the best-known solvers in the cryptographic category, namely, CryptoMiniSAT, Glucose, and MapleSAT. On the cryptographic benchmark, BMM-based solvers out-perform all other initialization methods. Further, the BMM-based MapleCOMSPS significantly out-perform the same solver using all other initialization methods by 12 additional instances solved and better average runtime, over the SAT 2018 competition benchmark.}

The i-FWER test allows much flexibility: a human (or a computer program acting on the human's behalf) may adaptively guide the algorithm in a data-dependent manner. We prove that our test controls FWER if the analysts adhere to a particular protocol of masking and unmasking. We demonstrate via numerical experiments the power of our test under structured non-nulls, and then explore new forms of masking.}

We bridge this gap by providing the first global convergence result for 2 layer non-linear neural networks with ReLU activations trained with a normalization layer, namely Weight Normalization. The analysis shows how the introduction of normalization layers changes the optimization landscape and in some settings enables faster convergence as compared with un-normalized neural networks.}

Another popular class of methods fits a conditional distribution to the parameter posterior directly, and a particular recent variant allows for the use of flexible neural density estimators for this task. In this work, we show that both of these approaches can be unified under a general contrastive learning scheme, and clarify how they should be run and compared.}

However, they generally struggle with underfitting at scale and parameter efficiency. On the other hand, deep ensembles have emerged as alternatives for uncertainty quantification that, while outperforming BNNs on certain problems, also suffer from efficiency issues. It remains unclear how to combine the strengths of these two approaches and remediate their common issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a rank-1 parameterization of BNNs, where each weight matrix involves only a distribution on a rank-1 subspace. We also revisit the use of mixture approximate posteriors to capture multiple modes, where unlike typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase (e.g., only a 0.4\% increase for a ResNet-50 mixture of size 10). We perform a systematic empirical study on the choices of prior, variational posterior, and methods to improve training. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, Wide ResNet 28-10 on CIFAR-10/100, and an RNN on MIMIC-III, rank-1 BNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance across log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration on the test sets and out-of-distribution variants.}

This enables a speed-up in inference, because it bypasses the need to invert large covariance matrices.

Yet, it is not preordained that accuracy should decrease with increased fairness. Novel to this work, we examine fair classification through the lens of mismatched hypothesis testing: trying to find a classifier that distinguishes between two ideal distributions when given two mismatched distributions that are biased. Using Chernoff information, a tool in information theory, we theoretically demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, there always exist ideal distributions such that optimal fairness and accuracy (with respect to the ideal distributions) are achieved simultaneously: there is no trade-off. Moreover, the same classifier yields the lack of a trade-off with respect to ideal distributions while yielding a trade-off when accuracy is measured with respect to the given (possibly biased) dataset. To complement our main result, we formulate an optimization to find ideal distributions and derive fundamental limits to explain why a trade-off exists on the given biased dataset. We also derive conditions under which active data collection can alleviate the fairness-accuracy trade-off in the real world. Our results lead us to contend that it is problematic to measure accuracy with respect to data that reflects bias, and instead, we should be considering accuracy with respect to ideal, unbiased data.}

In a number of applications, e.g. Poisson inverse problems or quantum state tomography, the loss is given by a self-concordant (SC) function having unbounded curvature, implying absence of theoretical guarantees for the existing FW methods. We use the theory of SC functions to provide a new adaptive step size for FW methods and prove global convergence rate O(1/k) after k iterations. If the problem admits a stronger local linear minimization oracle, we construct a novel FW method with linear convergence rate for SC functions.}

The teacher network's action is to select the most appropriate batch of data to train the student network on from a training set sorted according to entropy. By validating on three datasets, not only do we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tabular data and performs competitively on image recognition, but also that novel curricula are learned by the teacher network. We demonstrate experimentally that the teacher network can actively learn about the student network and guide it to achieve better performance than if trained alone.}

This natural loss function is known in the literature as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss, and we propose a tractable methodology called SPO Trees (SPOTs) for training decision trees under this loss. SPOTs benefit from the interpretability of decision trees, providing an interpretable segmentation of contextual features into groups with distinct optimal solutions to the optimization problem of interest. We conduct several numerical experiments on synthetic and real data including the prediction of travel times for shortest path problems and predicting click probabilities for news article recommendation.

  abstract =   {Convolutional neural networks are among the most successful architectures in deep learning with this success at least partially attributable to the efficacy of spatial invariance as an inductive bias. Locally connected layers, which differ from convolutional layers only in their lack of spatial invariance, usually perform poorly in practice. However, these observations still leave open the possibility that some degree of relaxation of spatial invariance may yield a better inductive bias than either convolution or local connectivity. To test this hypothesis, we design a method to relax the spatial invariance of a network layer in a controlled manner; we create a \emph{low-rank} locally connected layer, where the filter bank applied at each position is constructed as a linear combination of basis set of filter banks with spatially varying combining weights. By varying the number of basis filter banks, we can control the degree of relaxation of spatial invariance. In experiments with small convolutional networks, we find that relaxing spatial invariance improves classification accuracy over both convolution and locally connected layers across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets, thus suggesting that spatial invariance may be an overly restrictive prior.}

As such, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to multiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team of students independently in the quantized domain and simply stitching them afterwards. This divide and conquer strategy, makes the training of each student section possible in isolation, speeding up training by enabling parallelization. Experiments on various DNNs (AlexNet, LeNet, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN and VGG-11) show that, this approach{---}called DCQ (Divide and Conquer Quantization){---}on average, improves the performance of a state-of-the-art quantized training technique, DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) by 21.6\% and 9.3\% for binary and ternary quantization, respectively.

While over-parameterized models based on neural networks are now ubiquitous in machine learning applications, our understanding of their generalization capabilities is incomplete and this task is made harder by the non-convexity of the underlying learning problems. We provide a general framework to characterize the asymptotic generalization error for single-layer neural networks (i.e., generalized linear models) with arbitrary non-linearities, making it applicable to regression as well as classification problems. This framework enables analyzing the effect of (i) over-parameterization and non-linearity during modeling; (ii) choices of loss function, initialization, and regularizer during learning; and (iii) mismatch between training and test distributions. As examples, we analyze a few special cases, namely linear regression and logistic regression.

Previous algorithms achieve worse approximation guarantees using $\Omega(\log^2{n})$ parallel rounds. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our algorithm obtains solutions whose objective value nearly matches the value obtained by the state of the art sequential algorithms, and it outperforms previous parallel algorithms in number of parallel rounds, iterations, and solution quality.}

However, such models are often chosen to satisfy the Markov property to maintain tractability. One of the more popular of such memoryless models are Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs). In this work, we lift its restriction to exponential survival times to arbitrary distributions. Current extensions achieve this via auxiliary states, which hinder tractability. To avoid that, we introduce a set of node-wise clocks to construct a collection of graph-coupled semi-Markov chains. We provide algorithms for parameter and structure inference, which make use of local dependencies and conduct experiments on synthetic data and a data-set generated through a benchmark tool for gene regulatory networks. In doing so, we point out advantages compared to current CTBN extensions.}

  abstract =   {In distributed online optimization over a computing network with heterogeneous nodes, slow nodes can adversely affect the progress of fast nodes, leading to drastic slowdown of the overall convergence process. To address this issue, we consider a new algorithm termed Distributed Any-Batch Mirror Descent (DABMD), which is based on distributed Mirror Descent but uses a fixed per-round computing time to limit the waiting by fast nodes to receive information updates from slow nodes. DABMD is characterized by varying minibatch sizes across nodes. It is applicable to a broader range of problems compared with existing distributed online optimization methods such as those based on dual averaging, and it accommodates time-varying network topology. We study two versions of DABMD, depending on whether the computing nodes average their primal variables via single or multiple consensus iterations. We show that both versions provide strong theoretical performance guarantee, by deriving upperbounds on their expected dynamic regret, which capture the variability in minibatch sizes. Our experimental results show substantial reduction in cost and acceleration in convergence compared with the known best alternative.}

In this paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally, we provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains static.}

However, computing the embeddings for large-scale graphs is prohibitively inefficient even if we are interested only in a small subset of relevant vertices. To address this, we present an efficient graph coarsening approach, based on Schur complements, for computing the embedding of the relevant vertices. We prove that these embeddings are preserved exactly by the Schur complement graph that is obtained via Gaussian elimination on the non-relevant vertices. As computing Schur complements is expensive, we give a nearly-linear time algorithm that generates a coarsened graph on the relevant vertices that provably matches the Schur complement in expectation in each iteration. Our experiments involving prediction tasks on graphs demonstrate that computing embeddings on the coarsened graph, rather than the entire graph, leads to significant time savings without sacrificing accuracy.}

The algorithm has linear query complexity, and is optimal also in the streaming setting. To derive these results we consider a probabilistic setting where several candidates for a position are asked multiple questions with the goal of finding who has the highest probability of answering interview questions correctly. Previous work minimized the total number of questions asked by alternating back and forth between the best performing candidates, in a sense, inviting them to multiple interviews. We show that the same order-wise selection accuracy can be achieved by querying the candidates sequentially, never returning to a previously queried candidate. Hence one interview is enough!}

For a universality class of correlated Wigner models, GRAMPA achieves exact recovery of the latent matching between two graphs with edge correlation $1 - 1/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and average degree at least $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This matches the state-of-the-art guarantees for polynomial-time algorithms established for correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, and significantly improves over existing spectral methods. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.}

Despite the popularity of these clustering algorithms, there are not many provable methods for tuning these hyperparameters. In this paper, we provide an overarching framework with provable guarantees for tuning hyperparameters in the above class of problems under two different models. Our framework can be augmented with a cross validation procedure to do model selection as well. In a variety of simulation and real data experiments, we show that our framework outperforms other widely used tuning procedures in a broad range of parameter settings.}

We modify the OMD algorithm through a simple technique that we call stabilization. We give essentially the same abstract regret bound for OMD with stabilization and for DA by modifying the classical OMD convergence analysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward and flexible proofs. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with stabilization and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications---even under dynamic learning rates. We also shed light on the similarities between OMD and DA and show simple conditions under which stabilized-OMD and DA generate the same iterates.}

In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm, coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly stronger theoretical guarantees on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential games. We show extensive experiments on five games, where some variants of our methods outperform MCCFR.}

While GANs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark learning tasks, GAN minimax optimization still poses great theoretical and empirical challenges. GANs trained using first-order optimization methods commonly fail to converge to a stable solution where the players cannot improve their objective, i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the underlying game. Such issues raise the question of the existence of Nash equilibria in GAN zero-sum games. In this work, we show through theoretical and numerical results that indeed GAN zero-sum games may have no Nash equilibria. To characterize an equilibrium notion applicable to GANs, we consider the equilibrium of a new zero-sum game with an objective function given by a proximal operator applied to the original objective, a solution we call the proximal equilibrium. Unlike the Nash equilibrium, the proximal equilibrium captures the sequential nature of GANs, in which the generator moves first followed by the discriminator. We prove that the optimal generative model in Wasserstein GAN problems provides a proximal equilibrium. Inspired by these results, we propose a new approach, which we call proximal training, for solving GAN problems. We perform several numerical experiments indicating the existence of proximal equilibria in GANs.}

It notably covers the logistic model, widely used when rewards are binary. For logistic bandits, the frequentist regret guarantees of existing algorithms are $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa \sqrt{T})$, where $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent constant. Unfortunately, $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large as it scales exponentially with the size of the decision set. This may lead to significantly loose regret bounds and poor empirical performance. In this work, we study the logistic bandit with a focus on the prohibitive dependencies introduced by $\kappa$. We propose a new optimistic algorithm based on a finer examination of the non-linearities of the reward function. We show that it enjoys a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with no dependency in $\kappa$, but for a second order term. Our analysis is based on a new tail-inequality for self-normalized martingales, of independent interest.}

Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay {---} greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a novel problem setting to allow MCLs for each example and two ways for learning with MCLs. In the first way, we design two wrappers that decompose MCLs into many single CLs, so that we could use any method for learning with CLs. However, the supervision information that MCLs hold is conceptually diluted after decomposition. Thus, in the second way, we derive an unbiased risk estimator; minimizing it processes each set of MCLs as a whole and possesses an estimation error bound. We further improve the second way into minimizing properly chosen upper bounds. Experiments show that the former way works well for learning with MCLs but the latter is even better.}

These models feature optimizing agents who choose among a finite set of options in a sequence of periods and receive choice-specific payoffs that depend on both variables that are observed by the agent and recorded in the data and variables that are only observed by the agent but not recorded in the data. Existing work in Econometrics assumes that optimizing agents are fully rational and requires finding a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy. We show that in an important class of discrete choice models the value function is globally concave in the policy. That means that simple algorithms that do not require fixed point computation, such as the policy gradient algorithm, globally converge to the optimal policy. This finding can both be used to relax behavioral assumption regarding the optimizing agents and to facilitate Econometric analysis of dynamic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate significant computational advantages in using a simple implementation policy gradient algorithm over existing ``nested fixed point'' algorithms used in Econometrics.}

Each arm is a \emph{self-interested} strategic player who can modify its own reward whenever pulled, subject to a cross-period budget constraint, in order to maximize its own expected number of times of being pulled. We analyze the robustness of three popular bandit algorithms: UCB, $\varepsilon$-Greedy, and Thompson Sampling. We prove that all three algorithms achieve a regret upper bound $\mathcal{O}(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$ where $B$ is the total budget across arms, $K$ is the total number of arms and $T$ is the running time of the algorithms. This regret guarantee holds for \emph{arbitrary adaptive} manipulation strategy of arms. Our second set of main results shows that this regret bound is \emph{tight}--- in fact, for UCB, it is tight even when we restrict the arms' manipulation strategies to form a \emph{Nash equilibrium}. We do so by characterizing the Nash equilibrium of the game induced by arms' strategic manipulations and show a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$ at the equilibrium.}

This finds important applications in areas with high execution cost or safety concerns, such as medical diagnosis, recommendation systems and robotics. In practice, due to the limited information from off-policy data, it is highly desirable to construct rigorous confidence intervals, not just point estimation, for the policy performance. In this work, we propose a new variational framework which reduces the problem of calculating tight confidence bounds in OPE into an optimization problem on a feasible set that catches the true state-action value function with high probability. The feasible set is constructed by leveraging statistical properties of a recently proposed kernel Bellman loss (Feng et al., 2019). We design an efficient computational approach for calculating our bounds, and extend it to perform post-hoc diagnosis and correction for existing estimators. Empirical results show that our method yields tight confidence intervals in different settings.}

  abstract =   {Survival Analysis and Reliability Theory are concerned with the analysis of time-to-event data, in which observations correspond to waiting times until an event of interest such as death from a particular disease or failure of a component in a mechanical system. This type of data is unique due to the presence of censoring, a type of missing data that occurs when we do not observe the actual time of the event of interest but, instead, we have access to an approximation for it given by random interval in which the observation is known to belong. Most traditional methods are not designed to deal with censoring, and thus we need to adapt them to censored time-to-event data. In this paper, we focus on non-parametric goodness-of-fit testing procedures based on combining the Stein's method and kernelized discrepancies. While for uncensored data, there is a natural way of implementing a kernelized Stein discrepancy test, for censored data there are several options, each of them with different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a collection of kernelized Stein discrepancy tests for time-to-event data, and we study each of them theoretically and empirically; our experimental results show that our proposed methods perform better than existing tests, including previous tests based on a kernelized maximum mean discrepancy.}

This is especially known in the context of indexing data structures where, despite few attempts in evaluating their asymptotic efficiency, theoretical results are yet missing in showing that learned indexes are provably better than classic indexes, such as B+ trees and their variants. In this paper, we present the first mathematically-grounded answer to this open problem. We obtain this result by discovering and exploiting a link between the original problem and a mean exit time problem over a proper stochastic process which, we show, is related to the space and time complexity of those learned indexes. Our general result is then specialised to five well-known distributions: Uniform, Lognormal, Pareto, Exponential, and Gamma; and it is corroborated in precision and robustness by a large set of experiments.}

We deviate from this paradigm and provide a comprehensive study of learning in Stackelberg games. This work provides insights into the optimization landscape of zero-sum games by establishing connections between Nash and Stackelberg equilibria along with the limit points of simultaneous gradient descent. We derive novel gradient-based learning dynamics emulating the natural structure of a Stackelberg game using the implicit function theorem and provide convergence analysis for deterministic and stochastic updates for zero-sum and general-sum games. Notably, in zero-sum games using deterministic updates, we show the only critical points the dynamics converge to are Stackelberg equilibria and provide a local convergence rate. Empirically, our learning dynamics mitigate rotational behavior and exhibit benefits for training generative adversarial networks compared to simultaneous gradient descent.}

In principle, detection of and adaptation to OOD scenes can mitigate their adverse effects. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of current approaches to novel driving scenes and propose an epistemic uncertainty-aware planning method, called \emph{robust imitative planning} (RIP). Our method can detect and recover from some distribution shifts, reducing the overconfident and catastrophic extrapolations in OOD scenes. If the model's uncertainty is too great to suggest a safe course of action, the model can instead query the expert driver for feedback, enabling sample-efficient online adaptation, a variant of our method we term \emph{adaptive robust imitative planning} (AdaRIP). Our methods outperform current state-of-the-art approaches in the nuScenes \emph{prediction} challenge, but since no benchmark evaluating OOD detection and adaption currently exists to assess \emph{control}, we introduce an autonomous car novel-scene benchmark, \texttt{CARNOVEL}, to evaluate the robustness of driving agents to a suite of tasks with distribution shifts, where our methods outperform all the baselines.}

In practice this leads to dynamics equivalent to many hundreds or even thousands of layers. In this paper, we overcome this apparent difficulty by introducing a theoretically-grounded combination of both optimal transport and stability regularizations which encourage neural ODEs to prefer simpler dynamics out of all the dynamics that solve a problem well. Simpler dynamics lead to faster convergence and to fewer discretizations of the solver, considerably decreasing wall-clock time without loss in performance. Our approach allows us to train neural ODE-based generative models to the same performance as the unregularized dynamics, with significant reductions in training time. This brings neural ODEs closer to practical relevance in large-scale applications.}

Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method, we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular momentum.}

In this work we propose a novel online algorithm, Information Particle Filter Tree (IPFT), to solve problems with belief-dependent rewards on continuous domains. It simulates particle-based belief trajectories in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach to construct a search tree in the belief space. The evaluation shows that the consideration of information gain greatly improves the performance in problems where information gathering is an essential part of the optimal policy.}

FDMs model second moment under general generative assumptions on the data. While there is previous work on topic modeling using second moments, we develop a direct stochastic optimization procedure for fitting an FDM with a single Kullback Leibler objective. Moment methods in general have the benefit that an iteration no longer needs to scale with the size of the corpus. Our approach allows us to leverage standard optimizers and GPUs for the problem of topic modeling.

We show how to transform any oracle for online regression with a given value function class into an algorithm for contextual bandits with the induced policy class, with no overhead in runtime or memory requirements. We characterize the minimax rates for contextual bandits with general, potentially nonparametric function classes, and show that our algorithm is minimax optimal whenever the oracle obtains the optimal rate for regression. Compared to previous results, our algorithm requires no distributional assumptions beyond realizability, and works even when contexts are chosen adversarially.}

Prior work on local graph clustering mostly falls into two categories with numerical and combinatorial roots respectively, in this work we draw inspiration from both fields and propose a family of convex optimization formulations based on the idea of diffusion with $p$-norm network flow for $p\in (1,\infty)$. In the context of local clustering, we characterize the optimal solutions for these optimization problems and show their usefulness in finding low conductance cuts around input seed set. In particular, we achieve quadratic approximation of conductance in the case of $p=2$ similar to the Cheeger-type bounds of spectral methods, constant factor approximation when $p\rightarrow\infty$ similar to max-flow based methods, and a smooth transition for general $p$ values in between. Thus, our optimization formulation can be viewed as bridging the numerical and combinatorial approaches, and we can achieve the best of both worlds in terms of speed and noise robustness. We show that the proposed problem can be solved in strongly local running time for $p\ge 2$ and conduct empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graphs to illustrate our approach compares favorably with existing methods.}

An alternative is to use fully latent temporal models which untie frame synthesis and temporal dynamics. However, no such model for stochastic video prediction has been proposed in the literature yet, due to design and training difficulties. In this paper, we overcome these difficulties by introducing a novel stochastic temporal model whose dynamics are governed in a latent space by a residual update rule. This first-order scheme is motivated by discretization schemes of differential equations. It naturally models video dynamics as it allows our simpler, more interpretable, latent model to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.}

We perform a comprehensive analysis, showing that these artifacts are consistent across different neural network architectures, data sets, and resolutions. In a further investigation, we demonstrate that these artifacts are caused by upsampling operations found in all current GAN architectures, indicating a structural and fundamental problem in the way images are generated via GANs. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate how the frequency representation can be used to identify deep fake images in an automated way, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.}

Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each expert's best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each event. To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms, a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information settings. In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible.

Instead, it generates probabilistic training labels by estimating the accuracies of multiple noisy labeling sources (e.g., heuristics, crowd workers). Existing approaches use latent variable estimation to model the noisy sources, but these methods can be computationally expensive, scaling superlinearly in the data. In this work, we show that, for a class of latent variable models highly applicable to weak supervision, we can find a closed-form solution to model parameters, obviating the need for iterative solutions like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We use this insight to build FlyingSquid, a weak supervision framework that runs orders of magnitude faster than previous weak supervision approaches and requires fewer assumptions. In particular, we prove bounds on generalization error without assuming that the latent variable model can exactly parameterize the underlying data distribution. Empirically, we validate FlyingSquid on benchmark weak supervision datasets and find that it achieves the same or higher quality compared to previous approaches without the need to tune an SGD procedure, recovers model parameters 170 times faster on average, and enables new video analysis and online learning applications.}

However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD.}

However, existing methods mostly use a uniform mechanism that quantizes the values evenly. Such a scheme may cause a large quantization variance and slow down the convergence in practice. In this work, we introduce TinyScript, which applies a non-uniform quantization algorithm to both activations and gradients. TinyScript models the original values by a family of Weibull distributions and searches for ''quantization knobs'' that minimize quantization variance. We also discuss the convergence of the non-uniform quantization algorithm on DNNs with varying depths, shedding light on the number of bits required for convergence. Experiments show that TinyScript always obtains lower quantization variance, and achieves comparable model qualities against full precision training using 1-2 bits less than the uniform-based counterpart.}

However, compressive networks are desired in many real world applications and direct training of small networks may be trapped in local optima. In this paper, instead of pruning or distilling over-parameterized models to compressive ones, we propose a new approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces. Specifically, it generates a family of models from simple to complex ones that couples a pair of parameters to simultaneously train over-parameterized deep models and structural sparsity on weights of fully connected and convolutional layers. Such a differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, proposed as Deep structurally splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global convergence analysis in deep learning is established that from any initializations, algorithmic iterations converge to a critical point of empirical risks. Experimental evidence shows that DessiLBI achieve comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers in exploring the structural sparsity of several widely used backbones on the benchmark datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, DessiLBI unveils ``winning tickets'' in early epochs: the effective sparse structure with comparable test accuracy to fully trained over-parameterized models.}

  abstract =   {This paper proposes a new framework for providing approximation guarantees of local search algorithms. Local search is a basic algorithm design technique and is widely used for various combinatorial optimization problems. To analyze local search algorithms for set function maximization, we propose a new notion called \emph{localizability} of set functions, which measures how effective local improvement is. Moreover, we provide approximation guarantees of standard local search algorithms under various combinatorial constraints in terms of localizability. The main application of our framework is sparse optimization, for which we show that restricted strong concavity and restricted smoothness of the objective function imply localizability, and further develop accelerated versions of local search algorithms. We conduct experiments in sparse regression and structure learning of graphical models to confirm the practical efficiency of the proposed local search algorithms.}

  abstract =   {Posterior distribution approximation is a central task in Bayesian inference. Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and its extensions have been practically used and theoretically studied. While SGLD updates a single particle at a time, ensemble methods that update multiple particles simultaneously have been recently gathering attention. Compared with the naive parallel-chain SGLD that updates multiple particles independently, ensemble methods update particles with their interactions. Thus, these methods are expected to be more particle-efficient than the naive parallel-chain SGLD because particles can be aware of other particles' behavior through their interactions. Although ensemble methods numerically demonstrated their superior performance, no theoretical guarantee exists to assure such particle-efficiency and it is unclear whether those ensemble methods are really superior to the naive parallel-chain SGLD in the non-asymptotic settings. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel ensemble method that uses a non-reversible Markov chain for the interaction, and we present a non-asymptotic theoretical analysis for our method. Our analysis shows that, for the first time, the interaction causes a faster convergence rate than the naive parallel-chain SGLD in the non-asymptotic setting if the discretization error is appropriately controlled. Numerical experiments show that we can control the discretization error by tuning the interaction appropriately.}

The applicability of existing algorithms is however restricted by the fact that strong assumptions are often made on the delay distributions, such as full observability, restrictive shape constraints, or uniformity over arms. In this work, we weaken them significantly and only assume that there is a bound on the tail of the delay. In particular, we cover the important case where the delay distributions vary across arms, and the case where the delays are heavy-tailed. Addressing these difficulties, we propose a simple but efficient UCB-based algorithm called the PatientBandits.

We approach this problem through the unconventional angle of \emph{cognitive abstraction mechanisms}, drawing inspiration from recent neuroscience work, allowing us to define the Cognitive Neural Activation metric (CNA) for DNNs, which is the correlation between information complexity (entropy) of given input and the concentration of higher activation values in deeper layers of the network. The CNA is highly predictive of generalization ability, outperforming norm-and-sharpness-based generalization metrics on an extensive evaluation of close to 200 network instances comprising a breadth of dataset-architecture combinations, especially in cases where additive noise is present and/or training labels are corrupted. These strong empirical results show the usefulness of the CNA as a generalization metric and encourage further research on the connection between information complexity and representations in the deeper layers of networks in order to better understand the generalization capabilities of DNNs.}

We prescribe dynamical processes to traverse this surface under constraints, e.g., an iso-classification process that trades off rate and distortion to keep the classification loss unchanged. We demonstrate how this process can be used for transferring representations from a source dataset to a target dataset while keeping the classification loss constant. Experimental validation of the theoretical results is provided on standard image-classification datasets.}

In real-world applications, the gradient is not always available. To address the problem of lacking gradient in many applications, we propose two new stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithms and theoretically proved that they have a faster convergence rate than existing methods for non-convex problems. Specifically, the function queries oracle of the proposed faster zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (FZFW) method is $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon^2})$ which can match the iteration complexity of the first-order counterpart approximately. As for the proposed faster zeroth-order conditional gradient sliding (FZCGS) method, its function queries oracle is improved to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon})$, indicating that its iteration complexity is even better than that of its first-order counterpart NCGS-VR. In other words, the iteration complelxity of the accelerated first-order Frank-Wolfe method NCGS-VR is suboptimal. Then, we proposed a new algorithm to improve its IFO (incremental first-order oracle) to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}}{\epsilon})$. At last, the empirical studies on benchmark datasets validate our theoretical results.}

However, this view, which is often too pessimistic for real-world data, comes with a price. The complexity of solving many important online tasks in this adversarial framework becomes much worse than that of their offline and even stochastic counterparts. In this work we consider a natural random-order version of the OCO model, in which the adversary can choose the set of loss functions, but does not get to choose the order in which they are supplied to the learner; Instead, they are observed in uniformly random order. 	Focusing on two important families of online tasks, one in which the cumulative loss function is strongly convex (though individual loss functions may not even be convex), and the other being online $k$-PCA, we show that under standard well-conditioned-data assumptions, standard online gradient descent (OGD) methods become much more efficient in the random-order model. In particular, for the first group of tasks OGD guarantees poly-logarithmic regret. In the case of online $k$-PCA, OGD guarantees sublinear regret using only a rank-$k$ SVD on each iteration and memory linear in the size of the solution.}

Early work in RMDPs outputs generalized (instance-independent) first-order policies or value functions as a means to solve all instances of a domain at once. Unfortunately, this line of work met with limited success due to inherent limitations of the representation space used in such policies or value functions. Can neural models provide the missing link by easily representing more complex generalized policies, thus making them effective on all instances of a given domain? We present SymNet, the first neural approach for solving RMDPs that are expressed in the probabilistic planning language of RDDL. SymNet trains a set of shared parameters for an RDDL domain using training instances from that domain. For each instance, SymNet first converts it to an instance graph and then uses relational neural models to compute node embeddings. It then scores each ground action as a function over the first-order action symbols and node embeddings related to the action. Given a new test instance from the same domain, SymNet architecture with pre-trained parameters scores each ground action and chooses the best action. This can be accomplished in a single forward pass without any retraining on the test instance, thus implicitly representing a neural generalized policy for the whole domain. Our experiments on nine RDDL domains from IPPC demonstrate that SymNet policies are significantly better than random and sometimes even more effective than training a state-of-the-art deep reactive policy from scratch.}

Standard structured prediction models rely heavily on global scoring functions and are therefore unable to model individual player preferences or how they respond to others asymmetrically. Our games take as input, e.g., UN resolution to be voted on, and map such contexts to initial strategies, player utilities, and interactions. Players are then thought to repeatedly update their strategies in response to weighted aggregates of other players' choices towards maximizing their individual utilities. The output from the game is a sample from the resulting (near) equilibrium mixed strategy profile. We characterize conditions under which players' strategies converge to an equilibrium in such games and when the game parameters can be provably recovered from observations. Empirically, we demonstrate on two real voting datasets that our games can recover interpretable strategic interactions, and predict strategies for players in new settings.}

Such GNNs include the standard message passing models, and more powerful spatial variants that exploit local graph structure (e.g., via relative orientation of messages, or local port ordering) to distinguish neighbors of each node. Our treatment includes a novel graph-theoretic formalism. Second, we provide the first data dependent generalization bounds for message passing GNNs. This analysis explicitly accounts for the local permutation invariance of GNNs. Our bounds are much tighter than existing VC-dimension based guarantees for GNNs, and are comparable to Rademacher bounds for recurrent neural networks.}

PQR does not assume that the reward solely depends on the state, instead it allows for a dependency on the choice of action. Moreover, PQR allows for stochastic state transitions. To accomplish this, we assume the existence of one anchor action whose reward is known, typically the action of doing nothing, yielding no reward. We present both estimators and algorithms for the PQR method. When the environment transition is known, we prove that the PQR reward estimator uniquely recovers the true reward. With unknown transitions, we bound the estimation error of PQR. Finally, the performance of PQR is demonstrated by synthetic and real-world datasets.}

For example, humans can visualize a woman smiling after only seeing a smiling man. On the contrary, the standard conditional VAE (cVAE) is unable to generate unseen attribute combinations. To this end, we extend cVAE by introducing a multilinear latent conditioning framework that captures the multiplicative interactions between the attributes. We implement two variants of our model and demonstrate their efficacy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA. Altogether, we design a novel conditioning framework that can be used with any architecture to synthesize unseen attribute combinations.}

Specifically, given oracle access to a possibly non monotone function, we provide an algorithm that restores monotonicity while degrading the expected value of the function by at most $\epsilon$. The number of queries required is at most logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$ and exponential in the number of parameters. We also give a lower bound showing that this exponential dependence is necessary. Finally, we obtain improved query complexity bounds for restoring the weaker property of $k$-marginal monotonicity. Under this property, every $k$-dimensional projection of the function is required to be monotone. The query complexity we obtain only scales exponentially with $k$ and is polynomial in the number of parameters.}

Specifically, inclusion of a large number of irrelevant kernels may impair the accuracy, and increase the complexity of MKL algorithms. To enhance the accuracy, and alleviate the computational burden, the present paper develops a novel scheme which actively chooses relevant kernels. The proposed framework models the pruned kernel combination as feedback collected from a graph, that is refined 'on the fly.'

The goal is to design a joint perception and planning strategy for the agent that realizes the task with high probability. We develop a planning strategy that takes the semantic uncertainties into account and by doing so provides probabilistic guarantees on the task success. Furthermore, as new data arrive, the belief over the atomic propositions evolves and, subsequently, the planning strategy adapts accordingly. We evaluate the proposed method on various finite-horizon tasks in planar navigation settings where the empirical results show that the proposed method provides reliable task performance that also improves as the knowledge about the environment enhances.}

However, it is known that when cycles are allowed in the causal structure, conditional independence may not be a suitable notion for equivalence of two structures, as it does not reflect all the information in the distribution that is useful for identification of the underlying structure. In this paper, we present a general, unified notion of equivalence for linear Gaussian causal directed graphical models, whether they are cyclic or acyclic. In our proposed definition of equivalence, two structures are equivalent if they can generate the same set of data distributions. We also propose a weaker notion of equivalence called quasi-equivalence, which we show is the extent of identifiability from observational data. We propose analytic as well as graphical methods for characterizing the equivalence of two structures. Additionally, we propose a score-based method for learning the structure from observational data, which successfully deals with both acyclic and cyclic structures.}

In this paper, we obtain practical communication-efficient algorithms in the shuffled DP model for two basic aggregation primitives used in machine learning: 1) binary summation, and 2) histograms over a moderate number of buckets. Our algorithms achieve accuracy that is arbitrarily close to that of central DP algorithms with an expected communication per user essentially matching what is needed without any privacy constraints!

In this paper, we propose aligned cross entropy (AXE) as an alternative loss function for training of non-autoregressive models. AXE uses a differentiable dynamic program to assign loss based on the best possible monotonic alignment between target tokens and model predictions.

Practitioners face a difficult dilemma: choose an easy to use and performant TD method, or a more complex algorithm that is more sound but harder to tune and all but unexplored with non-linear function approximation or control. In this paper, we introduce a new method called TD with Regularized Corrections (TDRC), that attempts to balance ease of use, soundness, and performance. It behaves as well as TD, when TD performs well, but is sound in cases where TD diverges. We empirically investigate TDRC across a range of problems, for both prediction and control, and for both linear and non-linear function approximation, and show, potentially for the first time, that Gradient TD methods could be a better alternative to TD and Q-learning.}

  abstract =   {Shapley value is a classic notion from game theory, historically used to quantify the contributions of individuals within groups, and more recently applied to assign values to data points when training machine learning models. Despite its foundational role, a key limitation of the data Shapley framework is that it only provides valuations for points within a fixed data set. It does not account for statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to reason about points outside the data set. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework -- distributional Shapley-- where the value of a point is defined in the context of an underlying data distribution. We prove that distributional Shapley has several desirable statistical properties; for example, the values are stable under perturbations to the data points themselves and to the underlying data distribution. We leverage these properties to develop a new algorithm for estimating values from data, which comes with formal guarantees and runs two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art algorithms for computing the (non distributional) data Shapley values. We apply distributional Shapley to diverse data sets and demonstrate its utility in a data market setting.}

Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse applications. FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random geometric graphs (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with increasingly fractal behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse random geometric graphs that are parametrised by a fractality parameter $\nu$ which governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of fractality in its own right. We explore the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data. Finally, we explore fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block model in the setting of FGNs.}

In deep reinforcement learning, these issues have been dealt with empirically by adapting and regularizing the representation, in particular with auxiliary tasks. This suggests that representation learning may provide a means to guarantee stability. In this paper, we formally show that there are indeed nontrivial state representations under which the canonical SARSA algorithm is stable, even when learning off-policy. We analyze representation learning schemes that are based on the transition matrix of a policy, such as proto-value functions, along three axes: approximation error, stability, and ease of estimation. In the most general case of a defective transition matrix, we show that a Schur basis provides convergence guarantees, but is difficult to estimate from samples. For a fixed reward function, we find that an orthogonal basis of the corresponding Krylov subspace is an even better choice. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that these stable representations can be learned using stochastic gradient descent, opening the door to improved techniques for representation learning with deep networks.}

First, it establishes a sublinear rate of convergence for proximally regularized sketched CPD algorithms under two natural conditions that are known to be satisfied by many popular forms of sketching. Second, it demonstrates that the iterative nature of CPD algorithms can be exploited algorithmically to choose more performant sketching rates. This is accomplished by introducing CPD-MWU, a proximally-regularized sketched alternating least squares algorithm that adaptively selects the sketching rate at each iteration. On both synthetic and real data we observe that for noisy tensors CPD-MWU produces decompositions of comparable accuracy to the standard CPD decomposition in less time, often half the time; for ill-conditioned tensors, given the same time budget, CPD-MWU produces decompositions with an order-of-magnitude lower relative error. For a representative real-world dataset CPD-MWU produces residual errors on average 20\% lower than CPRAND-MIX and 44\% lower than SPALS, two recent sketched CPD algorithms.}

  abstract =   {When training an estimator such as a neural network for tasks like image denoising, it is often preferred to train one estimator and apply it to all noise levels. The de facto training protocol to achieve this goal is to train the estimator with noisy samples whose noise levels are uniformly distributed across the range of interest. However, why should we allocate the samples uniformly? Can we have more training samples that are less noisy, and fewer samples that are more noisy? What is the optimal distribution? How do we obtain such a distribution? The goal of this paper is to address this training sample distribution problem from a minimax risk optimization perspective. We derive a dual ascent algorithm to determine the optimal sampling distribution of which the convergence is guaranteed as long as the set of admissible estimators is closed and convex. For estimators with non-convex admissible sets such as deep neural networks, our dual formulation converges to a solution of the convex relaxation. We discuss how the algorithm can be implemented in practice. We evaluate the algorithm on linear estimators and deep networks.}

Prior work held only for gradient descent run with small batch sizes and sufficiently smooth classifiers. For classification, we give a stronger result, namely that any statistical query (SQ) algorithm will fail to achieve small test error in polynomial time. Our lower bounds hold for commonly used activations such as ReLU and sigmoid.

However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically plausible ECG training examples. We perform empirical evaluation and show that heart simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG classification.}

Recent research has been focused on studying this problem in the limit of infinite width and two different theories have been developed: a mean-field (MF) and a constant kernel (NTK) limit theories. We propose a general framework that provides a link between these seemingly distinct theories. Our framework out of the box gives rise to a discrete-time MF limit which was not previously explored in the literature. We prove a convergence theorem for it, and show that it provides a more reasonable approximation for finite-width nets compared to the NTK limit if learning rates are not very small. Also, our framework suggests a limit model that coincides neither with the MF limit nor with the NTK one. We show that for networks with more than two hidden layers RMSProp training has a non-trivial discrete-time MF limit but GD training does not have one. Overall, our framework demonstrates that both MF and NTK limits have considerable limitations in approximating finite-sized neural nets, indicating the need for designing more accurate infinite-width approximations for them.}

Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data {--} the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task.}

We argue for automating these transformations, and demonstrate that mechanisms available in recent modelling frameworks can implement non-centring and related reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms, and we propose two: a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can yield more efficient samplers than the best fixed parameterisation.}

In this paper we develop a method that could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human experts to analyze the validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is accomplished by highlighting observations in the data whose removal will have a large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating a set of rules for choosing which ones to present to domain experts for validation. We develop methods to compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation with two different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares, as well as importance sampling methods.

In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) setup for de novo drug design: Policy Gradient for Forward Synthesis (PGFS), that addresses this challenge by embedding the concept of synthetic accessibility directly into the de novo drug design system. In this setup, the agent learns to navigate through the immense synthetically accessible chemical space by subjecting initial commercially available molecules to valid chemical reactions at every time step of the iterative virtual synthesis process. The proposed environment for drug discovery provides a highly challenging test-bed for RL algorithms owing to the large state space and high-dimensional continuous action space with hierarchical actions. PGFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating structures with high QED and clogP. Moreover, we validate PGFS in an in-silico proof-of-concept associated with three HIV targets. Finally, we describe how the end-to-end training conceptualized in this study represents an important paradigm in radically expanding the synthesizable chemical space and automating the drug discovery process.}

Contrary to these methods, OrdNMF circumvents binarization and can exploit a more informative representation of the data. We design an efficient variational algorithm based on a suitable model augmentation and related to variational PF.

State-of-the-art methods aim to leverage deep learning to learn appropriate features via two main approaches. The first approach based on predicting transformations (Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019a) while successful in some domains, crucially depends on an appropriate domain-specific set of transformations that are hard to obtain in general. The second approach of minimizing a classical one-class loss on the learned final layer representations, e.g., DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) suffers from the fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work, we propose Deep Robust One Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable to most standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to representation collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from the class of interest lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets across different domains: tabular data, images (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and time-series, offering up to 20\% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection.

  abstract =   {The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets is limited due to heavy memory and computational requirements. A variety of methods has been proposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the kernel matrix. Previous methods, however, cannot easily deal with mixtures of non-stationary processes. This paper investigates an efficient GP framework, that extends structured kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary phase. We particularly treat the separation of nonstationary sources, which is a problem that commonly arises e.g. in spatio-temporal biomedical datasets. Our approach employs multiple sets of non-equidistant inducing points to account for the non-stationarity and retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker structure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient inference and kernel learning. Our approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and large spatio-temporal biomedical problems.}

We estimate the Stein discrepancy between the data density p(x) and the model density q(x) based on a vector function of the data. We parameterize this function with a neural network and fit its parameters to maximize this discrepancy. This yields a novel goodness-of-fit test which outperforms existing methods on high dimensional data. Furthermore, optimizing q(x) to minimize this discrepancy produces a novel method for training unnormalized models. This training method can fit large unnormalized models faster than existing approaches. The ability to both learn and compare models is a unique feature of the proposed method.}

Important instances arising in machine learning include hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and certain graph and recurrent neural networks. Typically the gradient of the upper-level objective (hypergradient) is hard or even impossible to compute exactly, which has raised the interest in approximation methods. We investigate some popular approaches to compute the hypergradient, based on reverse mode iterative differentiation and approximate implicit differentiation. Under the hypothesis that the fixed point equation is defined by a contraction mapping, we present a unified analysis which allows for the first time to quantitatively compare these methods, providing explicit bounds for their iteration complexity. This analysis suggests a hierarchy in terms of computational efficiency among the above methods, with approximate implicit differentiation based on conjugate gradient performing best. We present an extensive experimental comparison among the methods which confirm the theoretical findings.}

This loss-function encourages learning models where the distribution of the residuals between the label and the model prediction is statistically independent of the distribution of the instances themselves. This loss-function was first proposed by \citet{mooij2009regression} in the context of learning causal graphs. We adapt it to the task of learning for unsupervised covariate shift: learning on a source domain without access to any instances or labels from the unknown target domain, but with the assumption that $p(y|x)$ (the conditional probability of labels given instances) remains the same in the target domain. We show that the proposed loss is expected to give rise to models that generalize well on a class of target domains characterised by the complexity of their description within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Experiments on unsupervised covariate shift tasks demonstrate that models learned with the proposed loss-function outperform models learned with standard loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a challenging cell-microscopy unsupervised covariate shift task.}

So far, such representations were computed using either: (i) pre-computed implicit shape representations; or (ii) loss functions explicitly defined over the neural level-sets. In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (i.e., point clouds, with or without normal information). We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level-set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads to state-of-the-art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details and fidelity compared to previous methods.}

However, their saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono-initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.}

For inference, we develop a hybrid of stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo and recurrent autoencoding variational Bayes.

To cover all possible good architectures, we need to search in an extremely large search space with billions of candidate architectures. More critically, given a large search space, we may face a very challenging issue of space explosion. However, due to the limitation of computational resources, we can only sample a very small proportion of the architectures, which provides insufficient information for the training. As a result, existing methods may often produce sub-optimal architectures. To alleviate this issue, we propose a curriculum search method that starts from a small search space and gradually incorporates the learned knowledge to guide the search in a large space. With the proposed search strategy, our Curriculum Neural Architecture Search (CNAS) method significantly improves the search efficiency and finds better architectures than existing NAS methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

We study this problem by defining certified removal: a very strong theoretical guarantee that a model from which data is removed cannot be distinguished from a model that never observed the data to begin with. We develop a certified-removal mechanism for linear classifiers and empirically study learning settings in which this mechanism is practical.}

  abstract =   {Distribution shift is a major obstacle to the deployment of current deep learning models on real-world problems. Let $Y$ be the class label and $X$ the features. We focus on one type of distribution shift, \emph{ label shift}, where the label marginal distribution $P_Y$ changes but the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ does not. Most existing methods estimate the density ratio between the source- and target-domain label distributions by density matching. However, these methods are either computationally infeasible for large-scale data or restricted to shift correction for discrete labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Label Transformation Framework (LTF) for correcting label shift, which implicitly models the shift of $P_Y$ and the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ using neural networks. Thanks to the flexibility of deep networks, our framework can handle continuous, discrete, and even multi-dimensional labels in a unified way and is scalable to large data. Moreover, for high dimensional $X$, such as images, we find that the redundant information in $X$ severely degrades the estimation accuracy. To remedy this issue, we propose to match the distribution implied by our generative model and the target-domain distribution in a low-dimensional feature space that discards information irrelevant to $Y$. Both theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches.}

They provide sub-optimal end results and often require huge efforts for the trial-and-error process. In this work, we present an automated multi-task learning algorithm that learns where to share or branch within a network, designing an effective network topology that is directly optimized for multiple objectives across tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel tree-structured design space that casts a tree branching operation as a gumbel-softmax sampling procedure. This enables differentiable network splitting that is end-to-end trainable. We validate the proposed method on controlled synthetic data, CelebA, and Taskonomy.}

Although distributed learning techniques have been investigated extensively in deep learning, they are not directly applicable to stochastic AUC maximization with deep neural networks due to its striking differences from standard loss minimization problems (e.g., cross-entropy). Towards addressing this challenge, we propose and analyze a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm based on a \emph{non-convex concave} reformulation of the AUC maximization, in which the communication of both the primal variable and the dual variable between each worker and the parameter server only occurs after multiple steps of gradient-based updates in each worker. Compared with the naive parallel version of an existing algorithm that computes stochastic gradients at individual machines and averages them for updating the model parameter, our algorithm requires a much less number of communication rounds and still achieves linear speedup in theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} work that solves the \emph{non-convex concave min-max} problem for AUC maximization with deep neural networks in a communication-efficient distributed manner while still maintaining the linear speedup property in theory. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our algorithm and also confirm our theory.}

Here we introduce Predictions of Bootstrapped Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more. We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 multitask setting.}

In theory, the result learned from the new method is never worse than learning from merely labeled data, and it is theoretically guaranteed that its generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln(n)/n})$, even faster than the convergence rate in supervised learning associated with massive parameters. In the experiment of benchmark data, unlike the existing deep SSL methods which are no longer as good as supervised learning in 40\% of unseen-class unlabeled data, the new method can still achieve performance gain in more than 60\% of unseen-class unlabeled data. Moreover, the proposal is suitable for many deep SSL algorithms and can be easily extended to handle other cases of class distribution mismatch.}

Unsupervised topic modeling has been popularly used to discover topics from document collections. However, the application of topic modeling is challenging due to data sparsity, e.g., in a small collection of (short) documents and thus, generate incoherent topics and sub-optimal document representations. To address the problem, we propose a lifelong learning framework for neural topic modeling that can continuously process streams of document collections, accumulate topics and guide future topic modeling tasks by knowledge transfer from several sources to better deal with the sparse data. In the lifelong process, we particularly investigate jointly: (1) sharing generative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer prior knowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past learning via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic regularization approaches. Given a stream of document collections, we apply the proposed Lifelong Neural Topic Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three sparse document collections as future tasks and demonstrate improved performance quantiﬁed by perplexity, topic coherence and information retrieval task.

  abstract =   {In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming algorithms for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for non-monotone submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the currently tightest deterministic approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to a $k$-matchoid constraint. Moreover, we propose the first streaming algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to $k$-extendible and $k$-set system constraints. Together with our proposed reduction, we obtain $O(k\log k)$ and $O(k^2\log k)$ approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively. We extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the existing work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum independent set in randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over social networks, movie recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter data summarization.}

This phenomenon is observed in all the commonly used benchmarks we evaluated, including many image classification benchmarks, and one text classification benchmark. While this phenomenon is strongest for models of the same architecture, it also crosses architectural boundaries -- models of different architectures start by learning the same examples, after which the more powerful model may continue to learn additional examples. We further show that this pattern of results reflects the interplay between the way neural networks learn benchmark datasets. Specifically, when fixing the architecture, we describe synthetic datasets for which this pattern is no longer observed. When fixing the dataset, we show that other learning paradigms may learn the data in a different order. We hypothesize that our results reflect how neural networks discover structure in natural datasets.}

However, in many applications, such as structured sparse learning or batch Bayesian optimization, the objective function is not exactly submodular, but close. In this case, no theoretical guarantees exist. Indeed, submodular minimization algorithms rely on intricate connections between submodularity and convexity. We show how these relations can be extended to obtain approximation guarantees for minimizing non-submodular functions, characterized by how close the function is to submodular. We also extend this result to noisy function evaluations. Our approximation results are the first for minimizing non-submodular functions, and are optimal, as established by our matching lower bound.}

In this work, we propose an alternative approach whereby an ensemble of pre-trained base predictors is trained via federated learning. This method allows for training a model which may otherwise surpass the communication bandwidth and storage capacity of the clients to be learned with on-device data through federated learning. Motivated by language modeling, we prove the optimality of ensemble methods for density estimation for standard empirical risk minimization and agnostic risk minimization. We provide communication-efficient ensemble algorithms for federated learning, where per-round communication cost is independent of the size of the ensemble. Furthermore, unlike works on gradient compression, our proposed approach reduces the communication cost of both server-to-client and client-to-server communication.}

Formally, given low-rank matrix A = [Aij] and scalar non-linear function f, we aim for finding an approximated low-rank representation of the (possibly high-rank) matrix [f(Aij)]. To this end, we propose an efficient sketching-based algorithm whose complexity is significantly lower than the number of entries of A, i.e., it runs without accessing all entries of [f(Aij)] explicitly. The main idea underlying our method is to combine a polynomial approximation of f with the existing tensor sketch scheme for approximating monomials of entries of A. To balance the errors of the two approximation components in an optimal manner, we propose a novel regression formula to find polynomial coefficients given A and f. In particular, we utilize a coreset-based regression with a rigorous approximation guarantee. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the proposed scheme under various machine learning tasks.}

  abstract =   {Differentiable renderers have been used successfully for unsupervised 3D structure learning from 2D images because they can bridge the gap between 3D and 2D. To optimize 3D shape parameters, current renderers rely on pixel-wise losses between rendered images of 3D reconstructions and ground truth images from corresponding viewpoints. Hence they require interpolation of the recovered 3D structure at each pixel, visibility handling, and optionally evaluating a shading model. In contrast, here we propose a Differentiable Renderer Without Rendering (DRWR) that omits these steps. DRWR only relies on a simple but effective loss that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object silhouette. Specifically, DRWR employs a smooth silhouette loss to pull the projection of each individual 3D point inside the object silhouette, and a structure-aware repulsion loss to push each pair of projections that fall inside the silhouette far away from each other. Although we omit surface interpolation, visibility handling, and shading, our results demonstrate that DRWR achieves state-of-the-art accuracies under widely used benchmarks, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, our training times are significantly lower due to the simplicity of DRWR.}

In this paper, to relieve this issue, we propose stochastic integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA): in a mini-batch, we adopt gradient descent on good data as usual, and learning-rate-reduced gradient ascent on bad data; the proposal is a versatile approach where data goodness or badness is w.r.t. desired or undesired memorization given a base learning method. Technically, SIGUA pulls optimization back for generalization when their goals conflict with each other; philosophically, SIGUA shows forgetting undesired memorization can reinforce desired memorization. Experiments demonstrate that SIGUA successfully robustifies two typical base learning methods, so that their performance is often significantly improved.}

Each individual weight entry will not be binarized independently. Instead, they are taken as a whole to accomplish the binarization, just as they work together in generating convolution features. To help the training of the binarization mapping, the full-precision neurons after taking sign operations is regarded as some auxiliary supervision signal, which is noisy but still has valuable guidance. An unbiased estimator is therefore introduced to mitigate the influence of the supervision noise. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed binarization technique attains consistent improvements over baselines.}

(2019). We prove that as we vary the minibatch size, the global convergence rate of SSCN interpolates between the rate of stochastic coordinate descent (CD) and the rate of cubic regularized Newton, thus giving new insights into the connection between first and second-order methods. Remarkably, the local convergence rate of SSCN matches the rate of stochastic subspace descent applied to the problem of minimizing the quadratic function $\frac12 (x-x^*)^\top \nabla^2f(x^*)(x-x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the minimizer of $f$, and hence depends on the properties of $f$ at the optimum only. Our numerical experiments show that SSCN outperforms non-accelerated first-order CD algorithms while being competitive to their accelerated variants.}

However, ASVRCD incorporates Nesterov's momentum, which offers favorable iteration complexity guarantees over both SEGA and SVRCD. As a by-product of our theory, we show that a variant of Katyusha (Allen-Zhu, 2017) is a specific case of ASVRCD, recovering the optimal oracle complexity for the finite sum objective.}

For a large variety of distribution properties including four of the most popular ones and for every underlying distribution, they achieve the accuracy that the empirical-frequency plug-in estimators would attain using a logarithmic-factor more samples. Specifically, for Shannon entropy and a broad class of Lipschitz properties including the $L_1$ distance to a fixed distribution, the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the accuracy attained by the empirical estimators with $n\log n$ samples. For support-size and coverage, the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the performance of empirical frequency with sample size $n$ times the logarithm of the property value. Significantly strengthening the traditional min-max formulation, these results hold not only for the worst distributions, but for each and every underlying distribution. Furthermore, the logarithmic amplification factors are optimal. Experiments on a wide variety of distributions show that the new estimators outperform the previous state-of-the-art estimators designed for each specific property.}

  abstract =   {In E-commerce, advertising is essential for merchants to reach their target users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiser's cumulative revenue over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However, existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single ad exposures, ignoring the contribution of each exposure to the final conversion, thus usually falls into suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed bilevel optimization framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve the exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative revenue.}

Standard regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay or data augmentation sometimes help, but do not prevent this behavior. If one considers neural network weights as random variables that depend on the data and stochasticity of training, the amount of memorized information can be quantified with the Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training labels given inputs, $I(w; \mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x})$. We show that for any training algorithm, low values of this term correspond to reduction in memorization of label-noise and better generalization bounds. To obtain these low values, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing labels. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 corrupted with various noise models, and on a large-scale dataset Clothing1M that has noisy labels.}

Instead of using fixed sampling rates or hand-tuning themas model hyperparameters in existing stochastic regularization methods, our adaptive connection sampling can be trained jointly with GNN model parameters in both global and local fashions. GNN training with adaptive connection sampling is shown to be mathematically equivalent to an efficient approximation of training BayesianGNNs. Experimental results with ablation studies on benchmark datasets validate that adaptively learning the sampling rate given graph training data is the key to boost the performance of GNNs in semi-supervised node classification, less prone to over-smoothing and over-fitting with more robust prediction.}

While differentiable trees demonstrate promising results in the literature, they are typically slow in training and inference as they do not support conditional computation. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new sparse activation function for sample routing, and implement true conditional computation by developing specialized forward and backward propagation algorithms that exploit sparsity. Our efficient algorithms pave the way for jointly training over deep and wide tree ensembles using first-order methods (e.g., SGD). Experiments on 23 classification datasets indicate over 10x speed-ups compared to the differentiable trees used in the literature and over 20x reduction in the number of parameters compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining competitive performance. Moreover, experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST indicate that replacing dense layers in CNNs with our tree layer reduces the test loss by 7-53\% and the number of parameters by 8x.

For signal recovery from a few measurements, however, un-trained convolutional networks have an intriguing self-regularizing property: Even though the network can perfectly fit any image, the network recovers a natural image from few measurements when trained with gradient descent until convergence. In this paper, we provide numerical evidence for this property and study it theoretically. We show that---without any further regularization---an un-trained convolutional neural network can approximately reconstruct signals and images that are sufficiently structured, from a near minimal number of random measurements.}

  abstract =   {Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a fundamental problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent can massively improve the sample efficiency of a more complex one. To this end, we propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies into two parts: an independently learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level policy. To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly released navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies.

In contrast to previous work on delayed multi-armed bandits, we focus on games with continuous action spaces, and we examine the long-run behavior of strategic agents that follow a no-regret learning policy (but are otherwise oblivious to the game being played, the objectives of their opponents, etc.). To account for the lack of a consistent stream of information (for instance, rewards can arrive out of order and with an a priori unbounded delay), we introduce a gradient-free learning policy where payoff information is placed in a priority queue as it arrives. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that under a standard diagonal concavity assumption, the induced sequence of play converges to Nash Equilibrium (NE) with probability 1, even if the delay between choosing an action and receiving the corresponding reward is unbounded.}

This new implementation produces features which support state-of-the-art linear classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. When used as input for non-linear classification with deep neural networks, this representation allows us to use 2-5x less labels than classifiers trained directly on image pixels. Finally, this unsupervised representation substantially improves transfer learning to object detection on the PASCAL VOC dataset, surpassing fully supervised pre-trained ImageNet classifiers.}

The convergence rate of the method depends on the square root of the relative condition number between the global and local loss functions. We estimate the relative condition number for linear prediction models by studying uniform concentration of the Hessians over a bounded domain, which allows us to derive improved convergence rates for existing preconditioned gradient methods and our accelerated method. Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the benefits of acceleration in the ill-conditioned regime.}

However, such a model is prone to overfitting due to scarcity of human annotations, and requires costly retraining. Moreover, it is almost infeasible for the human annotators to examine attentions on tons of instances and features. We tackle these challenges by proposing a sample-efficient attention mechanism and a cost-effective reranking algorithm for instances and features. First, we propose Neural Attention Processes (NAP), which is an attention generator that can update its behaviour by incorporating new attention-level supervisions without any retraining. Secondly, we propose an algorithm which prioritizes the instances and the features by their negative impacts, such that the model can yield large improvements with minimal human feedback. We validate IAL on various time-series datasets from multiple domains (healthcare, real-estate, and computer vision) on which it significantly outperforms baselines with conventional attention mechanisms, or without cost-effective reranking, with substantially less retraining and human-model interaction cost.}

We achieve this by learning a flexible amortized estimator which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. We demonstrate that the learned ratio estimator can be embedded in \textsc{mcmc} samplers to approximate likelihood-ratios between consecutive states in the Markov chain, allowing us to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are presented to improve the numerical stability and to measure the quality of an approximation. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated on a variety of benchmarks against well-established techniques. Scientific applications in physics show its applicability.}

  abstract =   {The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution, which is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence machine learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many online learning schemes include drift detection to actively detect and react to observed changes. Yet, reliable drift detection constitutes a challenging problem in particular in the context of high dimensional data, varying drift characteristics, and the absence of a parametric model such as a classification scheme which reflects the drift. In this paper we present a novel concept drift detection method, Dynamic Adapting Window Independence Drift Detection (DAWIDD), which aims for non-parametric drift detection of diverse drift characteristics. For this purpose, we establish a mathematical equivalence of the presence of drift to the dependency of specific random variables in an according drift process. This allows us to rely on independence tests rather than parametric models or the classification loss, resulting in a fairly robust scheme to universally detect different types of drift, as it is also confirmed in experiments.}

The pAp@k metric, which combines the partial-AUC and the precision@k metrics, was recently proposed to evaluate such recommendation systems and has been used in real-world deployments. Conceptually, pAp@k measures the probability of correctly ranking a top-ranked positive instance over top-ranked negative instances. Due to the combinatorial aspect surfaced by top-ranked points, little is known about the characteristics and optimization methods of pAp@k. In this paper, we analyze the learning-theoretic properties of pAp@k, particularly its benefits in evaluating modern recommender systems, and propose novel surrogates that are consistent under certain data regularity conditions. We then provide gradient descent based algorithms to optimize the surrogates directly. Our analysis and experimental evaluation suggest that pAp@k indeed exhibits a certain dual behavior with respect to partial-AUC and precision@k. Moreover, the proposed methods outperform all the baselines in various applications. Taken together, our results motivate the use of pAp@k for large-scale recommender systems with heterogeneous user-engagement.}

These approaches, however, require imposing restrictive assumptions on the explorable space of structures such as limiting the active candidate pool, thus depending heavily on the intuition of domain experts. This paper instead proposes \textbf{DTERGENS}, a novel generative search framework that constructs and optimizes a high-performance composite kernel expressions generator. \textbf{DTERGENS} does not restrict the space of candidate kernels and is capable of obtaining flexible length expressions by jointly optimizing a generative termination criterion. We demonstrate that our framework explores more diverse kernels and obtains better performance than state-of-the-art approaches on many real-world predictive tasks.}

Existing literature achieves this via a local knowledge distillation scheme that transfuses the predictive patterns of each pre-trained expert onto a white-box imitator model, which can be incorporated efficiently into a global model. This scheme however does not extend to multi-task scenarios where different experts were trained to solve different tasks and only part of their distilled knowledge is relevant to a new task. To address this multi-task challenge, we develop a new fusion paradigm that represents each expert as a distribution over a spectrum of predictive prototypes, which are isolated from task-specific information encoded within the prototype distribution. The task-agnostic prototypes can then be reintegrated to generate a new model that solves a new task encoded with a different prototype distribution. The fusion and adaptation performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated empirically on several real-world benchmark datasets.}

The framework can be applied to a wide range of settings from semi-supervised, multi-task to supervised and robust learning. We show that the training objective of PARADISE can be seen as a form of regularization that helps improve generalization. With an emphasis on robust learning we further develop a novel posterior matching objective to encourage smoothness on the loss function and show that PARADISE can significantly improve interpretability as well as robustness to adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our model reduces standard and adversarial error rates in comparison to the state-of-the-art by 50\% and 41\%, respectively without the expensive computational cost of adversarial training.}

In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to the Markov chain not having burned in) may track that of VI (due to the optimizer not having converged), up to differences due to VI's asymptotic bias and parameterization. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and their momentum-accelerated counterparts) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it's far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).}

Additionally, we propose efficient cutting plane algorithms for separating the proposed linear inequalities. The lifted disjoint path problem is a natural model for multiple object tracking and allows an elegant mathematical formulation for long range temporal interactions. Lifted edges help to prevent id switches and to re-identify persons. Our lifted disjoint paths tracker achieves nearly optimal assignments with respect to input detections.

We provide a rigorous extension of these results to NNs involving attention layers, showing that unlike single-head attention, which induces non-Gaussian behaviour, multi-head attention architectures behave as GPs as the number of heads tends to infinity. We further discuss the effects of positional encodings and layer normalisation, and propose modifications of the attention mechanism which lead to improved results for both finite and infinitely wide NNs. We evaluate attention kernels empirically, leading to a moderate improvement upon the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 for GPs without trainable kernels and advanced data preprocessing. Finally, we introduce new features to the Neural Tangents library (Novak et al.,2020) allowing applications of NNGP/NTK models, with and without attention, to variable-length sequences, with an example on the IMDb reviews dataset.}

  abstract =   {Many large-scale machine learning (ML) applications need to perform decentralized learning over datasets generated at different devices and locations. Such datasets pose a significant challenge to decentralized learning because their different contexts result in significant data distribution skew across devices/locations. In this paper, we take a step toward better understanding this challenge by presenting a detailed experimental study of decentralized DNN training on a common type of data skew: skewed distribution of data labels across devices/locations. Our study shows that: (i) skewed data labels are a fundamental and pervasive problem for decentralized learning, causing significant accuracy loss across many ML applications, DNN models, training datasets, and decentralized learning algorithms; (ii) the problem is particularly challenging for DNN models with batch normalization; and (iii) the degree of data skew is a key determinant of the difficulty of the problem. Based on these findings, we present SkewScout, a system-level approach that adapts the communication frequency of decentralized learning algorithms to the (skew-induced) accuracy loss between data partitions. We also show that group normalization can recover much of the accuracy loss of batch normalization.}

  abstract =   {We consider the problem of zero-shot coordination - constructing AI agents that can coordinate with novel partners they have not seen before (e.g.humans). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods typically focus on the self-play (SP) setting where agents construct strategies by playing the game with themselves repeatedly. Unfortunately, applying SP naively to the zero-shot coordination problem can produce agents that establish highly specialized conventions that do not carry over to novel partners they have not been trained with. We introduce a novel learning algorithm called other-play (OP), that enhances self-play by looking for more robust strategies. We characterize OP theoretically as well as experimentally. We study the cooperative card game Hanabi and show that OP agents achieve higher scores when paired with independently trained agents as well as with human players than SP agents.}

However, these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English, and despite an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that enables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of languages and tasks is still missing. To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There is also a wide spread of results across languages. We will release the benchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer linguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and tasks.}

Log-likelihood is an appealing metric due to its grounding in statistics and information theory, but it can be challenging to estimate for implicit generative models, and scalar-valued metrics give an incomplete picture of a model's quality. In this work, we propose to use rate distortion (RD) curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models. While estimating RD curves is seemingly even more computationally demanding than log-likelihood estimation, we show that we can approximate the entire RD curve using nearly the same computations as were previously used to achieve a single log-likelihood estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of VAEs, GANs, and adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Measuring the entire RD curve gives a more complete picture than scalar-valued metrics, and we arrive at a number of insights not obtainable from log-likelihoods alone.}

We investigate whether there exists a single global policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies -- ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed as Shared Modular Policies (SMP), that correspond to each of the agent's actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training -- a process that would normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology. We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.

Gradient optimization with attention layers can be notoriously difficult requiring tricks such as learning rate warmup to prevent divergence. As Transformer models are becoming larger and more expensive to train, recent research has focused on understanding and improving optimization in these architectures. In this work our contributions are two-fold: we first investigate and empirically validate the source of optimization problems in the encoder-decoder Transformer architecture; we then propose a new weight initialization scheme with theoretical justification, that enables training without warmup or layer normalization. Empirical results on public machine translation benchmarks show that our approach achieves leading accuracy, allowing to train deep Transformer models with 200 layers in both encoder and decoder (over 1000 attention/MLP blocks) without difficulty.

With this perspective, we propose two general principles: 1) monotonically decreasing and 2) margin probability penalty, for designing new margin loss functions. Unlike methods optimized with single comparison metric, we provide a new perspective to treat open set face recognition as a problem of information transmission. And the generalization capability for face embedding is gained with more clean information. An auto-encoder architecture called Linear-Auto-TS-Encoder(LATSE) is proposed to corroborate this finding. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that LATSE help face embedding to gain more generalization capability and it boost the single model performance with open training dataset to more than 99\% on MegaFace test.}

We propose a neurosymbolic program synthesis algorithm that combines a policy neural network with enumerative search to generate such relational programs. The policy neural network employs a program interpreter that provides immediate feedback on the consequences of the decisions made by the policy, and also takes into account the uncertainty in the symbolic representation of the image. We evaluate our algorithm on challenging benchmarks based on the CLEVR dataset, and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms several baselines.}

Such mental processes are difficult to model in real-world problems such as in conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR), as the percepts (if they are modelled as graphs indicating relationships among utterances) are supposed to be innumerable and not directly observable. In this paper, we present a Bayesian nonparametric deep learning method called deep graph random process (DGP) that can generate an infinite number of probabilistic graphs representing percepts. We further provide a closed-form solution for coupling and transformation of these percept graphs for acoustic modeling. Our approach is able to successfully infer relations among utterances without using any relational data during training.

It was observed \cite{arora2019exact} that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression using the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. We study the dynamic of neural networks of finite width and derive an infinite hierarchy of differential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH). We prove that the NTH hierarchy truncated at the level $p\geq 2$ approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to arbitrary precision under certain conditions on the neural network width and the data set dimension. The assumptions needed for these approximations become weaker as $p$ increases. Finally, NTH can be viewed as higher order extensions of NTK. In particular, the NTH truncated at $p=2$ recovers the NTK dynamics.}

We derive a generalized conservation law that preserves the path of parameter dynamics from curvature correction, which shows that curvature correction only modifies the temporal profiles of dynamics along the path. We show that while curvature correction accelerates the convergence dynamics of the input-output map, it can also negatively affect the generalization performance. Our analysis also reveals an undesirable effect of curvature correction that compromises stability of parameters dynamics during learning, especially with block-diagonal approximation of natural gradient descent. We introduce fractional curvature correction that resolves this problem while retaining most of the acceleration benefits of full curvature correction.}

Distinct from strategies that connect neural networks to external memory banks via intricately crafted controllers and hand-designed attentional mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed, co-located alongside computation, and implicitly addressed, while being drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting networks with multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories, while multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully connected networks. Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these capabilities on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, and question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results.}

While the posterior leverages both the labeled support and query data, the conditional prior is based only on the labeled support data. We show that in earlier work, relying on Monte-Carlo approximation, the conditional prior collapses to a Dirac delta function. In contrast, our variational approach prevents this collapse and preserves uncertainty over the model parameters. We evaluate our approach on the miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and FC100 datasets, and present results demonstrating its advantages over previous work.}

We cast saddle-point and min-max problems as 2-player games. We leverage tools from single-objective convex optimisation to propose new linear lower bounds for convex-concave games. Notably, we give a linear lower bound for $n$-player differentiable games, by using the spectral properties of the update operator. We then propose a new definition of the condition number arising from our lower bound analysis. Unlike past definitions, our condition number captures the fact that linear rates are possible in games, even in the absence of strong convexity or strong concavity in the variables.}

  abstract =   {The deterministic CUR matrix decomposition is a low-rank approximation method to analyze a data matrix. It has attracted considerable attention due to its high interpretability, which results from the fact that the decomposed matrices consist of subsets of the original columns and rows of the data matrix. The subset is obtained by optimizing an objective function with sparsity-inducing norms via coordinate descent. However, the existing algorithms for optimization incur high computation costs. This is because coordinate descent iteratively updates all the parameters in the objective until convergence. This paper proposes a fast deterministic CUR matrix decomposition. Our algorithm safely skips unnecessary updates by efficiently evaluating the optimality conditions for the parameters to be zeros. In addition, we preferentially update the parameters that must be nonzeros. Theoretically, our approach guarantees the same result as the original approach. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm speeds up the deterministic CUR while achieving the same accuracy.}

  abstract =   {Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero \emph{training error}. Even after memorization, the \emph{training loss} continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, it is hard to tune their hyperparameters in order to maintain a fixed/preset level of training loss. We propose a direct solution called \emph{flooding} that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the \emph{flood level}. Our approach makes the loss float around the flood level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flood level. This can be implemented with one line of code and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With flooding, the model will continue to ``random walk'' with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and, as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss.}

We study the correlation clustering problem under the following assumption: Every "similar" edge $e$ has weight $w_e \in [ \alpha w, w ]$ and every "dissimilar" edge $e$ has weight $w_e \geq \alpha w$ (where $\alpha \leq 1$ and $w > 0$ is a scaling parameter).

We propose a two-stage framework where the agent first infers action representations from action information acquired separately from the task. A policy flexible to varying action sets is then trained with generalization objectives. We benchmark generalization on sequential tasks, such as selecting from an unseen tool-set to solve physical reasoning puzzles and stacking towers with novel 3D shapes.

We show that the density quantile functions of the source and target density provide a precise characterization of the slope of transformation required to capture tails in a target density. We further show that any Lipschitz-continuous transport map acting on a source density will result in a density with similar tail properties as the source, highlighting the trade-off between the importance of choosing a complex source density and a sufficiently expressive transformation to capture desirable properties of a target density. Subsequently, we illustrate that flow models like Real-NVP, MAF, and Glow as implemented lack the ability to capture a distribution with non-Gaussian tails. We circumvent this problem by proposing tail-adaptive flows consisting of a source distribution that can be learned simultaneously with the triangular map to capture tail-properties of a target density. We perform several synthetic and real-world experiments to complement our theoretical findings.}

It allows to keep the appealing geometrical properties of the unregularized Wasserstein distance while having a significantly lower complexity thanks to Sinkhorn's algorithm. However, entropy brings some inherent smoothing bias, resulting for example in blurred barycenters. This side effect has prompted an increasing temptation in the community to settle for a slower algorithm such as log-domain stabilized Sinkhorn which breaks the parallel structure that can be leveraged on GPUs, or even go back to unregularized OT. Here we show how this bias is tightly linked to the reference measure that defines the entropy regularizer and propose debiased Sinkhorn barycenters that preserve the best of worlds: fast Sinkhorn-like iterations without entropy smoothing. Theoretically, we prove that this debiasing is perfect for Gaussian distributions with equal variance. Empirically, we illustrate the reduced blurring and the computational advantage.}

Unfortunately, the resulting predictive distributions often exhibit substantially underestimated uncertainties. Notably, in the regression case the predictive variance is typically dominated by observation noise, yielding uncertainty estimates that make little use of the input-dependent function uncertainty that makes GP priors attractive. In this work we propose two simple methods for scalable GP regression that address this issue and thus yield substantially improved predictive uncertainties. The first applies variational inference to FITC (Fully Independent Training Conditional; Snelson et. al. 2006). The second bypasses posterior approximations and instead directly targets the posterior predictive distribution. In an extensive empirical comparison with a number of alternative methods for scalable GP regression, we find that the resulting predictive distributions exhibit significantly better calibrated uncertainties and higher log likelihoods--often by as much as half a nat per datapoint.}

In this setting, *active sensing* is the goal-oriented problem of efficiently selecting which acquisitions to make, and when and what decision to settle on. As its complement, *inverse active sensing* seeks to uncover an agent's preferences and strategy given their observable decision-making behavior. In this paper, we develop an expressive, unified framework for the general setting of evidence-based decision-making under endogenous, context-dependent time pressure---which requires negotiating (subjective) tradeoffs between accuracy, speediness, and cost of information. Using this language, we demonstrate how it enables *modeling* intuitive notions of surprise, suspense, and optimality in decision strategies (the forward problem). Finally, we illustrate how this formulation enables *understanding* decision-making behavior by quantifying preferences implicit in observed decision strategies (the inverse problem).}

This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses deep generative models as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and noise-annealed Langevin dynamics to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, providing quantitative evaluation and qualitative discussion of results for CIFAR-10 image separation. We also provide qualitative results on LSUN.}

This approach provably exhibits a better rate of convergence than full extra-gradient for non-smooth convex games with noisy gradient oracle. We propose an additional variance reduction mechanism to obtain speed-ups in smooth convex games. Our approach makes extrapolation amenable to massive multiplayer settings, and brings empirical speed-ups, in particular when using a heuristic cyclic sampling scheme.~Most importantly, it allows to train faster and better GANs and mixtures of GANs.}

Detecting these GAN-generated images (GAN-images) becomes increasingly challenging due to the significant reduction of underlying artifacts and specific patterns. The absence of such traces can hinder detection algorithms from identifying GAN-images and transferring knowledge to identify other types of GAN-images as well. In this work, we present the Transferable GAN-images Detection framework T-GD, a robust transferable framework for an effective detection of GAN-images. T-GD is composed of a teacher and a student model that can iteratively teach and evaluate each other to improve the detection performance. First, we train the teacher model on the source dataset and use it as a starting point for learning the target dataset. To train the student model, we inject noise by mixing up the source and target datasets, while constraining the weight variation to preserve the starting point. Our approach is a self-training method, but distinguishes itself from prior approaches by focusing on improving the transferability of GAN-image detection. T-GD achieves high performance on the source dataset by overcoming catastrophic forgetting and effectively detecting state-of-the-art GAN-images with only a small volume of data without any metadata information.}

Batch-size adaptation thus arises as a promising approach to accelerate such algorithms. However, existing schemes either apply prescribed batch-size adaption rule or exploit the information along optimization path via additional backtracking and condition verification steps. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, which eliminates backtracking line search but still exploits the information along optimization path by adapting the batch size via history stochastic gradients. We further theoretically show that such a scheme substantially reduces the overall complexity for popular variance-reduced algorithms SVRG and SARAH/SPIDER for both conventional nonconvex optimization and reinforcement learning problems. To this end, we develop a new convergence analysis framework to handle the dependence of the batch size on history stochastic gradients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed batch-size adaptation scheme.}

However, these methods suffer from pseudo-label bias in the form of error accumulation. We propose a method that removes the need for explicit optimization of model parameters from pseudo-labels. Instead, we present a sampling-based implicit alignment approach, where the sample selection is implicitly guided by the pseudo-labels. Theoretical analysis reveals the existence of a domain-discriminator shortcut in misaligned classes, which is addressed by the proposed approach to facilitate domain-adversarial learning. Empirical results and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially in the presence of within-domain class imbalance and between-domain class distribution shift.}

  abstract =   {Recent work showed that overparameterized autoencoders can be trained to implement associative memory via iterative maps, when the trained input-output Jacobian of the network has all of its eigenvalue norms strictly below one. Here, we theoretically analyze this phenomenon for sigmoid networks by leveraging recent developments in deep learning theory, especially the correspondence between training neural networks in the infinite-width limit and performing kernel regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We find that overparameterized sigmoid autoencoders can have attractors in the NTK limit for both training with a single example and multiple examples under certain conditions. In particular, for multiple training examples, we find that the norm of the largest Jacobian eigenvalue drops below one with increasing input norm, leading to associative memory.}

  abstract =   {Graph generation techniques are increasingly being adopted for drug discovery. Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades significantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs significantly larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.}

In terms of generative modeling, the goal is to learn to sample molecules in the intersection of multiple property constraints. This task becomes increasingly challenging when there are many property constraints. We propose to offset this complexity by composing molecules from a vocabulary of substructures that we call molecular rationales. These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest. We evaluate our model on various drug design tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty of generated compounds.}

  abstract =   {Exploration is widely regarded as one of the most challenging aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), with many naive approaches succumbing to exponential sample complexity. To isolate the challenges of exploration, we propose the following ``reward-free RL'' framework. In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories from an MDP $M$ without a pre-specified reward function. After exploration, it is tasked with computing a near-policies under the transitions of $\mathcal{M}$ for a collection of given reward functions. This framework is particularly suitable where there are many reward functions of interest, or where the reward function is shaped by an external agent to elicit desired behavior. We give an efficient algorithm that conducts $\widetilde{O}(S^2A\mathrm{poly}(H)/\epsilon^2)$ episodes of exploration, and returns $\epsilon$-suboptimal policies for an arbitrary number of reward functions. We achieve this by finding exploratory policies that jointly visit each ``significant'' state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation probability under any possible policy. Moreover, our planning procedure can be instantiated by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or natural policy gradient. Finally, we give a nearly-matching $\Omega(S^2AH^2/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm in this setting.}

  abstract =   {Minimax optimization has found extensive applications in modern machine learning, in settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adversarial training and multi-agent reinforcement learning. As most of these applications involve continuous nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, a very basic question arises---``what is a proper definition of local optima?'' Most previous work answers this question using classical notions of equilibria from simultaneous games, where the min-player and the max-player act simultaneously. In contrast, most applications in machine learning, including GANs and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games, where the order of which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general not equal to maximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems). The main contribution of this paper is to propose a proper mathematical definition of local optimality for this sequential setting---local minimax, as well as to present its properties and existence results. Finally, we establish a strong connection to a basic local search algorithm---gradient descent ascent (GDA): under mild conditions, all stable limit points of GDA are exactly local minimax points up to some degenerate points.}

When applied to a $\gamma$-discounted MDP with $A_{tot}$ total actions our method computes an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with an expected $\widetilde{O}((1-\gamma)^{-4} A_{tot} \epsilon^{-2})$ samples, improving over the best-known primal-dual methods while matching the state-of-the-art up to a $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ factor. Both methods are model-free, update state values and policies simultaneously, and run in time linear in the number of samples taken.

This hardness of learning with limited computational budget is shown to be characterized by a novel quantity called vertex overlap ratio. Such quantity is universally valid for many specific graph structures including cliques and nearest neighbors. On the other side, we attain the optimal rates for testing these structures against empty graph by proposing the quadratic testing statistics to match the lower bounds. We also investigate the relationship between computational bounds and information-theoretic bounds for such problems, and found gaps between the two boundaries in inferring some particular structures, especially for those with dense edges.}

Re-tuning learning rates is resource intensive, while fixed scaling rules often degrade model quality. We propose AdaScale SGD, an algorithm that reliably adapts learning rates to large-batch training. By continually adapting to the gradient's variance, AdaScale automatically achieves speed-ups for a wide range of batch sizes. We formally describe this quality with AdaScale's convergence bound, which maintains final objective values, even as batch sizes grow large and the number of iterations decreases. In empirical comparisons, AdaScale trains well beyond the batch size limits of popular ``linear learning rate scaling'' rules. This includes large-batch training with no model degradation for machine translation, image classification, object detection, and speech recognition tasks. AdaScale's qualitative behavior is similar to that of "warm-up" heuristics, but unlike warm-up, this behavior emerges naturally from a principled mechanism. The algorithm introduces negligible computational overhead and no new hyperparameters, making AdaScale an attractive choice for large-scale training in practice.}

Given the good performance of RGANs, this suggests that Wasserstein GAN does not performs well primarily because of the weak metric, but rather because of regularization and the use of a relativistic discriminator. We introduce the minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for Relativistic paired GANs (RpGANs; originally called RGANs which could bring confusion) and show that it does not perform better. We show that the estimator of Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs) is asymptotically unbiased and that the finite-sample bias is small; removing this bias does not improve performance.}

Specifically, this paper examines this fair variant of the k-centers problem, where a subset of the data with cardinality k is chosen to minimize distance to the rest of the data. Previous papers working on this problem presented both a 3-approximation algorithm with a super-linear runtime and a linear-time algorithm whose approximation factor is exponential in the number of demographic groups. This paper combines the best of each algorithm by presenting a linear-time algorithm with a guaranteed 3-approximation factor and provides empirical evidence of both the algorithm's runtime and effectiveness.}

In particular, we tighten a recent result of Cutkosky (2019) to demonstrate theoretically that online iterate averaging results in a reduced optimization gap, independently of the algorithm involved. We show that carefully combining this technique with existing generic optimistic online learning algorithms yields the optimal accelerated rates for optimizing strongly-convex and non-strongly-convex, possibly composite objectives, with deterministic as well as stochastic first-order oracles. We further extend this idea to variance-reduced optimization. Finally, we also provide ``universal'' algorithms that achieve the optimal rate for smooth and non-smooth composite objectives simultaneously without further tuning, generalizing the results of Kavis et al.

Reinforcement learning (RL), building on Bellman's optimality equation, naturally optimizes for a single goal, yet can be made goal-directed by augmenting the state with the goal. Instead, we propose a new RL framework, derived from a dynamic programming equation for the all pairs shortest path (APSP) problem, which naturally solves goal-directed queries. We show that this approach has computational benefits for both standard and approximate dynamic programming. Interestingly, our formulation prescribes a novel protocol for computing a trajectory: instead of predicting the next state given its predecessor, as in standard RL, a goal-conditioned trajectory is constructed by first predicting an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the trajectory into two. Then, recursively, predicting intermediate points on each sub-segment, until a complete trajectory is obtained. We call this trajectory structure a sub-goal tree. Building on it, we additionally extend the policy gradient methodology to recursively predict sub-goals, resulting in novel goal-based algorithms. Finally, we apply our method to neural motion planning, where we demonstrate significant improvements compared to standard RL on navigating a 7-DoF robot arm between obstacles.}

  abstract =   {Given n values possessed by n agents, we study the problem of estimating the mean by truthfully eliciting agents' answers to multiple-choice questions about their values. We consider two natural candidates for estimation error: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). We design a randomized estimator which is asymptotically optimal for both measures in the worst case. In the case where prior distributions over the agents' values are known, we give an optimal, polynomial-time algorithm for MSE, and show that the task of computing an optimal estimate for MAE is #P-hard. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that knowledge of prior distributions gives a significant edge.}

This assumption naturally leads to the common choice of a standard Gaussian prior over continuous latent variables. Recent work has, however, shown that this prior has a detrimental effect on model capacity, leading to subpar performance. We propose that the Euclidean assumption lies at the heart of this failure mode. To counter this, we assume a Riemannian structure over the latent space, which constitutes a more principled geometric view of the latent codes, and replace the standard Gaussian prior with a Riemannian Brownian motion prior. We propose an efficient inference scheme that does not rely on the unknown normalizing factor of this prior. Finally, we demonstrate that this prior significantly increases model capacity using only one additional scalar parameter.}

We show existing OPE estimators may fail to be efficient in this setting. We develop a new estimator based on cross-fold estimation of $q$-functions and marginalized density ratios, which we term double reinforcement learning (DRL). We show that DRL is efficient when both components are estimated at fourth-root rates and is also doubly robust when only one component is consistent.

Inspired by the success of deep learning in modeling images, recent work starting with Bora-Jalal-Price-Dimakis'17 has instead considered structure to come from a generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$. We present two results establishing the difficulty and strength of this latter task, showing that existing bounds are tight: First, we provide a lower bound matching the Bora et.al upper bound for compressed sensing with $L$-Lipschitz generative models $G$ which holds even for the more relaxed goal of \emph{non-uniform} recovery. Second, we show that generative models generalize sparsity as a representation of structure by constructing a ReLU-based neural network with $2$ hidden layers and $O(n)$ activations per layer whose range is precisely the set of all $k$-sparse vectors.}

A significant advancement in natural-language understanding has come with the development of pre-trained contextual embeddings, such as BERT, which can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks with less labeled data and training budget, while achieving better accuracies. However, there is no attempt yet to obtain a high-quality contextual embedding of source code, and to evaluate it on multiple program-understanding tasks simultaneously; that is the gap that this paper aims to mitigate. Specifically, first, we curate a massive, deduplicated corpus of 7.4M Python files from GitHub, which we use to pre-train CuBERT, an open-sourced code-understanding BERT model; and, second, we create an open-sourced benchmark that comprises five classification tasks and one program-repair task, akin to code-understanding tasks proposed in the literature before. We fine-tune CuBERT on our benchmark tasks, and compare the resulting models to different variants of Word2Vec token embeddings, BiLSTM and Transformer models, as well as published state-of-the-art models, showing that CuBERT outperforms them all, even with shorter training, and with fewer labeled examples. Future work on source-code embedding can benefit from reusing our benchmark, and from comparing against CuBERT models as a strong baseline.}

To this end, we learn differentiable masks for individual channels and make soft decisions throughout the optimization procedure, which facilitates to explore larger search space and train more stable networks. The proposed framework enables us to identify compressed models via a joint learning of model parameters and channel pruning without an extra procedure of fine-tuning.

The standard optimization algorithm used in this setting is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) due to its low communication cost. We obtain a tight characterization of the convergence of FedAvg and prove that heterogeneity (non-iid-ness) in the client's data results in a `drift' in the local updates resulting in poor performance. As a solution, we propose a new algorithm (SCAFFOLD) which uses control variates (variance reduction) to correct for the `client drift'. We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client's data yielding even faster convergence. The latter is the first result to quantify the usefulness of local-steps in distributed optimization.}

The DisCo transformer is trained to predict every output token given an arbitrary subset of the other reference tokens. We also develop the parallel easy-first inference algorithm, which iteratively refines every token in parallel and reduces the number of required iterations. Our extensive experiments on 7 translation directions with varying data sizes demonstrate that our model achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state of the art in non-autoregressive machine translation while significantly reducing decoding time on average.}

We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks.

If the embedding were isometric, this issue can be solved, because the relation of PDFs can become tractable. To achieve isometric property, we propose Rate-Distortion Optimization guided autoencoder inspired by orthonormal transform coding. We show our method has the following properties: (i) the Jacobian matrix between the input space and a Euclidean latent space forms a constantly-scaled orthonormal system and enables isometric data embedding; (ii) the relation of PDFs in both spaces can become tractable one such as proportional relation. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised anomaly detection with four public datasets.}

  abstract =   {Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) has been broadly applied to the problem of identifying smooth, low-dimensional temporal structure underlying large-scale neural recordings. However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, which motivates combining GPFA with discrete observation models for binned spike count data. The drawback to this approach is that GPFA priors are not conjugate to count model likelihoods, which makes inference challenging. Here we address this obstacle by introducing a fast, approximate inference method for non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach uses orthogonal second-order polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms in the non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a method we refer to as polynomial approximate log-likelihood (PAL) estimators. This approximation allows for accurate closed-form evaluation of marginal likelihoods and fast numerical optimization for parameters and hyperparameters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFA models with binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial observations and find the PAL estimation is highly accurate, and achieves faster convergence times compared to existing state-of-the-art inference methods. We also find that PAL hyperparameters can provide sensible initialization for black box variational inference (BBVI), which improves BBVI accuracy. We demonstrate that PAL estimators achieve fast and accurate extraction of latent structure from multi-neuron spike train data.}

This, however, is not a fundamental constraint but just a lack of functionality in classic ODE solvers, which do not return a likelihood but a point estimate. To address this shortcoming, we employ Gaussian ODE filtering (a probabilistic numerical method for ODEs) to construct a local Gaussian approximation to the likelihood. This approximation yields tractable estimators for the gradient and Hessian of the (log-)likelihood. Insertion of these estimators into existing gradient-based optimization and sampling methods engenders new solvers for ODE inverse problems. We demonstrate that these methods outperform standard likelihood-free approaches on three benchmark-systems.}

Our main result is that even when there is no information deficiency specific to one group (e.g., both groups have infinite data), adding the same amount of feature noise to all individuals leads to loss discrepancy. 	For linear regression, we thoroughly characterize the effect of feature noise on loss discrepancy in terms of the amount of noise, the difference between moments of the two groups, and whether group information is used or not. 	We then show this loss discrepancy does not vanish immediately if a shift in distribution causes the groups to have similar moments. 	On three real-world datasets, we show feature noise increases the loss discrepancy if groups have different distributions, while it does not affect the loss discrepancy on datasets where groups have similar distributions.}

We find that, under common training procedures, the emergent languages are subject to an entropy minimization pressure that has also been detected in human language, whereby the mutual information between the communicating agent's inputs and the messages is minimized, within the range afforded by the need for successful communication. That is, emergent languages are (nearly) as simple as the task they are developed for allow them to be. This pressure is amplified as we increase communication channel discreteness. Further, we observe that stronger discrete-channel-driven entropy minimization leads to representations with increased robustness to overfitting and adversarial attacks. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the study of natural and artificial communication systems.}

For example, a hospital holds a dataset of sensitive medical records and outsources the BO task on this dataset to an industrial AI company. The key idea of our approach is to make the BO performance of our algorithm similar to that of non-private GP-UCB run using the original dataset, which is achieved by using a random projection-based transformation that preserves both privacy and the pairwise distances between inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is to show that a regret bound similar to that of the standard GP-UCB algorithm can be established for our PO-GP-UCB algorithm.

Gibson (1977) coined the term "affordances" to describe the fact that certain states enable an agent to do certain actions, in the context of embodied agents. In this paper, we develop a theory of affordances for agents who learn and plan in Markov Decision Processes. Affordances play a dual role in this case. On one hand, they allow faster planning, by reducing the number of actions available in any given situation. On the other hand, they facilitate more efficient and precise learning of transition models from data, especially when such models require function approximation. We establish these properties through theoretical results as well as illustrative examples. We also propose an approach to learn affordances and use it to estimate transition models that are simpler and generalize better.}

  abstract =   {Group fairness, a class of fairness notions that measure how different groups of individuals are treated differently according to their protected attributes, has been shown to conflict with one another, often with a necessary cost in loss of model's predictive performance. We propose a general diagnostic that enables systematic characterization of these trade-offs in group fairness. We observe that the majority of group fairness notions can be expressed via the fairness-confusion tensor, which is the confusion matrix split according to the protected attribute values. We frame several optimization problems that directly optimize both accuracy and fairness objectives over the elements of this tensor, which yield a general perspective for understanding multiple trade-offs including group fairness incompatibilities. It also suggests an alternate post-processing method for designing fair classifiers. On synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the use cases of our diagnostic, particularly on understanding the trade-off landscape between accuracy and fairness.}

In this regard, a number of mixup based augmentation methods have been recently proposed. However, these approaches mainly focus on creating previously unseen virtual examples and can sometimes provide misleading supervisory signal to the network. To this end, we propose Puzzle Mix, a mixup method for explicitly utilizing the saliency information and the underlying statistics of the natural examples. This leads to an interesting optimization problem alternating between the multi-label objective for optimal mixing mask and saliency discounted optimal transport objective. Our experiments show Puzzle Mix achieves the state of the art generalization and the adversarial robustness results compared to other mixup methods on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, and the source code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/PuzzleMix.}

Many prior works require paired, aligned demonstrations and an additional RL step that requires environment interactions. However, paired, aligned demonstrations are seldom obtainable and RL procedures are expensive. In this work, we formalize the Domain Adaptive Imitation Learning (DAIL) problem - a unified framework for imitation learning in the presence of viewpoint, embodiment, and/or dynamics mismatch. Informally, DAIL is the process of learning how to perform a task optimally, given demonstrations of the task in a distinct domain. We propose a two step approach to DAIL: alignment followed by adaptation. In the alignment step we execute a novel unsupervised MDP alignment algorithm, Generative Adversarial MDP Alignment (GAMA), to learn state and action correspondences from \emph{unpaired, unaligned} demonstrations. In the adaptation step we leverage the correspondences to zero-shot imitate tasks across domains. To describe when DAIL is feasible via alignment and adaptation, we introduce a theory of MDP alignability. We experimentally evaluate GAMA against baselines in embodiment, viewpoint, and dynamics mismatch scenarios where aligned demonstrations don't exist and show the effectiveness of our approach}

However, learning and reasoning about high-dimensional models with nondifferentiable densities are still a challenge. For such a model, inference algorithms struggle to estimate the gradients of variational objectives accurately, due to high variance in their estimates. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel variational inference algorithm for sequential data, which performs well even when the density from the model is not differentiable, for instance, due to the use of discrete random variables. The key feature of our algorithm is that it estimates future likelihoods at all time steps. The estimated future likelihoods form the core of our new low-variance gradient estimator. We formally analyze our gradient estimator from the perspective of variational objective, and show the effectiveness of our algorithm with synthetic and real datasets.}

To do so, we construct a curious agent building world models while visually exploring a 3D physical environment rich with distillations of representative real-world agents. We propose an AWML system driven by $\gamma$-Progress: a scalable and effective learning progress-based curiosity signal and show that $\gamma$-Progress naturally gives rise to an exploration policy that directs attention to complex but learnable dynamics in a balanced manner, as a result overcoming the ``white noise problem''. As a result, our $\gamma$-Progress-driven controller achieves significantly higher AWML performance than baseline controllers equipped with state-of-the-art exploration strategies such as Random Network Distillation and Model Disagreement.}

The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data collected in scientific experiments. A fundamental question is how to design the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters. For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior. Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions.}

State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end to go directly from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("bone spurs") or bird attributes ("wing color"). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.}

We leverage a controllable data generation setup with PDE solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze generalization benefits of an adjustable training data difficulty and demonstrate the robustness of LSiM via an evaluation on three real-world data sets.}

To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density -- in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential -- are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by equivariant normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.}

Synchronization MABs are inspired by online caching scenarios such as Web crawling, where an arm corresponds to a cached item and playing the arm means downloading its fresh copy from a server. We present MirrorSync, an online learning algorithm for synchronization bandits, establish an adversarial regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ for it, and show how to make it practical.}

Our algorithmic framework covers local SGD updates and synchronous and pairwise gossip updates on adaptive network topology. We derive universal convergence rates for smooth (convex and non-convex) problems and the rates interpolate between the heterogeneous (non-identically distributed data) and iid-data settings, recovering linear convergence rates in many special cases, for instance for over-parametrized models. Our proofs rely on weak assumptions (typically improving over prior work in several aspects) and recover (and improve) the best known complexity results for a host of important scenarios, such as for instance coorperative SGD and federated averaging (local SGD).}

We study a fundamental question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for such a graceful exchange to hold; there is little loss in sample complexity even when we only have access to small data tasks. To this end, we introduce a novel spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples.}

We propose a new method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective. The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty. Based on this perspective, we propose a neural stochastic differential equation model (SDE-Net) which consists of (1) a drift net that controls the system to fit the predictive function; and (2) a diffusion net that captures epistemic uncertainty. We theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to SDE-Net. Our experiments demonstrate that the SDE-Net model can outperform existing uncertainty estimation methods across a series of tasks where uncertainty plays a fundamental role.}

It is known that in the single-source case, an adversary with the power to corrupt a fixed fraction of the training data can prevent PAC-learnability, that is, even in the limit of infinitely much training data, no learning system can approach the optimal test error. In this work we show that, surprisingly, the same is not true in the multi-source setting, where the adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a fixed fraction of the data sources. Our main results are a generalization bound that provides finite-sample guarantees for this learning setting, as well as corresponding lower bounds.

Approximate Bayesian inference has been empirically demonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks, although the theoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations is limited. We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore, we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty on a ReLU network is ``to be a bit Bayesian''. These theoretical results validate the usage of last-layer Bayesian approximation and motivate a range of a fidelity-cost trade-off. We further validate these findings empirically via various standard experiments using common deep ReLU networks and Laplace approximations.}

Our proposal is a sequential stage-wise learning process that improves generalization capabilities of a given modeling system. We justify this method via technical results and on Audioset, the largest sound events dataset, our sequential learning approach can lead to up to 9\% improvement in performance.

In this work, we show that extending the smoothing technique to defend against other attack models can be challenging, especially in the high-dimensional regime. In particular, for a vast class of i.i.d.~smoothing distributions, we prove that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}})$ with dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence on $d$ is no better than that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using isotropic Gaussian smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the robustness radius. When restricted to \emph{generalized} Gaussian smoothing, these two bounds can be shown to be within a constant factor of each other in an asymptotic sense, establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best possible results, up to a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present experimental results on CIFAR to validate our theory. For other smoothing distributions, such as, a uniform distribution within an $\ell_1$ or an $\ell_\infty$-norm ball, we show upper bounds of the form $O(1 / d)$ and $O(1 / d^{1 - \frac{1}{p}})$ respectively, which have an even worse dependence on $d$.}

To adapt to larger shifts we consider gradual domain adaptation, where the goal is to adapt an initial classifier trained on a source domain given only unlabeled data that shifts gradually in distribution towards a target domain. We prove the first non-vacuous upper bound on the error of self-training with gradual shifts, under settings where directly adapting to the target domain can result in unbounded error. The theoretical analysis leads to algorithmic insights, highlighting that regularization and label sharpening are essential even when we have infinite data. Leveraging the gradual shift structure leads to higher accuracies on a rotating MNIST dataset, a forest Cover Type dataset, and a realistic Portraits dataset.}

  abstract =   {While the impact of variational inference (VI) on posterior inference in a fixed generative model is well-characterized, its role in regularizing a learned generative model when used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) is poorly understood. We study the regularizing effects of variational distributions on learning in generative models from two perspectives. First, we analyze the role that the choice of variational family plays in imparting uniqueness to the learned model by restricting the set of optimal generative models. Second, we study the regularization effect of the variational family on the local geometry of the decoding model. This analysis uncovers the regularizer implicit in the $\beta$-VAE objective, and leads to an approximation consisting of a deterministic autoencoding objective plus analytic regularizers that depend on the Hessian or Jacobian of the decoding model, unifying VAEs with recent heuristics proposed for training regularized autoencoders. We empirically verify these findings, observing that the proposed deterministic objective exhibits similar behavior to the $\beta$-VAE in terms of objective value and sample quality.}

These methods define a cooperative game between the features of a model and distribute influence among these input elements using some form of the game's unique Shapley values. Justification for these methods rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning. We also draw on additional literature to argue that Shapley values do not provide explanations which suit human-centric goals of explainability.}

  abstract =   {The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily for its use of non-local weight transport --- the biologically dubious requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local learning mechanisms.}

Although most existing methods assume that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption is not necessarily valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning problem for dense subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge subsets rather than only single edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights in a queried subset. For this problem, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution with high probability. Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more scalable algorithm with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

  abstract =   {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.}

  abstract =   {Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is studied extensively with the focus of maximizing prediction accuracy given an overall parameter budget. Existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic non-uniform sparsity budgets which have sub-optimal layer-wise parameter allocation resulting in a) lower prediction accuracy or b) higher inference cost (FLOPs). This work proposes Soft Threshold Reparameterization (STR), a novel use of the soft-threshold operator on DNN weights. STR smoothly induces sparsity while learning pruning thresholds thereby obtaining a non-uniform sparsity budget. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for unstructured sparsity in CNNs (ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), and, additionally, learns non-uniform budgets that empirically reduce the FLOPs by up to 50\%. Notably, STR boosts the accuracy over existing results by up to 10\% in the ultra sparse (99\%) regime and can also be used to induce low-rank (structured sparsity) in RNNs. In short, STR is a simple mechanism which learns effective sparsity budgets that contrast with popular heuristics.

While WDRO has received attention as a promising tool for inference since its introduction, its theoretical understanding has not been fully matured. Gao et al. (2017) proposed a minimizer based on a tractable approximation of the local worst-case risk, but without showing risk consistency. In this paper, we propose a minimizer based on a novel approximation theorem and provide the corresponding risk consistency results. Furthermore, we develop WDRO inference for locally perturbed data that include the Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) as a special case. We show that our approximation and risk consistency results naturally extend to the cases when data are locally perturbed. Numerical experiments demonstrate robustness of the proposed method using image classification datasets. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy than baseline models on noisy datasets.}

For the sub-Gaussian and light-tailed cases, we use a classical CVaR estimator based on the empirical distribution constructed from the samples. For heavy-tailed random variables, we assume a mild `bounded moment' condition, and derive a concentration bound for a truncation-based estimator. Our concentration bounds exhibit exponential decay in the sample size, and are tighter than those available in the literature for the above distribution classes. To demonstrate the applicability of our concentration results, we consider the CVaR optimization problem in a multi-armed bandit setting. Specifically, we address the best CVaR-arm identification problem under a fixed budget. Using our CVaR concentration results, we derive an upper-bound on the probability of incorrect arm identification.}

We consider first-order methods, where the gradients are pre-conditioned by an approximation of the Hessian, based on a subspace embedding of the data matrix. This class of algorithms encompasses several randomized methods among the fastest solvers for least-squares problems. We focus on two classical embeddings, namely, Gaussian projections and subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHT). Our key technical innovation is the derivation of the limiting spectral density of SRHT embeddings. Leveraging this novel result, we derive the family of normalized orthogonal polynomials of the SRHT density and we find the optimal pre-conditioned first-order method along with its rate of convergence. Our analysis of Gaussian embeddings proceeds similarly, and leverages classical random matrix theory results. In particular, we show that for a given sketch size, SRHT embeddings exhibits a faster rate of convergence than Gaussian embeddings. Then, we propose a new algorithm by optimizing the computational complexity over the choice of the sketching dimension. To our knowledge, our resulting algorithm yields the best known complexity for solving least-squares problems with no condition number dependence.}

Although primarily used in finite dimension for problems like multi-task regression, the ability of this framework to deal with infinite dimensional output spaces unlocks many more applications, such as functional regression, structured output prediction, and structured data representation. However, these sophisticated schemes crucially rely on the kernel trick in the output space, so that most of previous works have focused on the square norm loss function, completely neglecting robustness issues that may arise in such surrogate problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper develops a duality approach that allows to solve OVK machines for a wide range of loss functions. The infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers are handled through a Double Representer Theorem, and algorithms for \epsilon-insensitive losses and the Huber loss are thoroughly detailed. Robustness benefits are emphasized by a theoretical stability analysis, as well as empirical improvements on structured data applications.}

An unresolved foundational question in this area is the difference between with-replacement sampling and without-replacement sampling --- does the latter have superior convergence rate compared to the former? A groundbreaking result of Recht and R\'e reduces the problem to a noncommutative analogue of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality where $n$ positive numbers are replaced by $n$ positive definite matrices. If this inequality holds for all $n$, then without-replacement sampling (also known as random reshuffling) indeed outperforms with-replacement sampling in some important optimization problems. The conjectured Recht--R\'e inequality has so far only been established for $n = 2$ and a special case of $n = 3$. We will show that the Recht--R\'e conjecture is false for general $n$. Our approach relies on the noncommutative Positivstellensatz, which allows us to reduce the conjectured inequality to a semidefinite program and the validity of the conjecture to certain bounds for the optimum values, which we show are false as soon as $n = 5$.}

We develop a novel method, called Bidirectional Model-based Policy Optimization (BMPO) to utilize both the forward model and backward model to generate short branched rollouts for policy optimization. Furthermore, we theoretically derive a tighter bound of return discrepancy, which shows the superiority of BMPO against the one using merely the forward model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BMPO outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.}

We propose a novel framework for generating robust and stable explanations of black box models based on adversarial training. Our framework optimizes a minimax objective that aims to construct the highest fidelity explanation with respect to the worst-case over a set of adversarial perturbations. We instantiate this algorithm for explanations in the form of linear models and decision sets by devising the required optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this work makes the first attempt at generating post hoc explanations that are robust to a general class of adversarial perturbations that are of practical interest. Experimental evaluation with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our approach substantially improves robustness of explanations without sacrificing their fidelity on the original data distribution.}

Second, when the activation functions is differentiable, it provides an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the network. Such bound is tighter than the trivial layer-wise product of Lipschitz constants, motivating its use for training networks robust to adversarial perturbations. In practical experiments we illustrate the advantages of using the proximal mapping and we compare the robustness-accuracy trade-off induced by the 1-path-norm, L1-norm and layer-wise constraints on the Lipschitz constant (Parseval networks).}

[2019] implies that searching for a near-optimal action in a bandit sometimes requires examining essentially all the actions, even if the learner is given linear features in R^d that approximate the rewards with a small uniform error. We use the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem to prove a positive result that by checking only a few actions, a learner can always find an action that is suboptimal with an error of at most O($\epsilon$$\sqrt{}$d) where $\epsilon$ is the approximation error of the features. Thus, features are useful when the approximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features. The idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a generative model where the learner has access to d-dimensional linear features that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an accuracy of $\epsilon$. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of order d$\sqrt{}$(n log(k)) + $\epsilon$n$\sqrt{}$d log(n) with k the number of actions and n the horizon. For RL we show that approximate policy iteration can learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order $\epsilon$$\sqrt{}$d/(1 − $\gamma$)^2 and using about d/($\epsilon$^2(1 − $\gamma$)^4) samples from the generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the features. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.}

  abstract =   {Heretofore, neural networks with external memory are restricted to single memory with lossy representations of memory interactions. A rich representation of relationships between memory pieces urges a high-order and segregated relational memory. In this paper, we propose to separate the storage of individual experiences (item memory) and their occurring relationships (relational memory). The idea is implemented through a novel Self-attentive Associative Memory (SAM) operator. Found upon outer product, SAM forms a set of associative memories that represent the hypothetical high-order relationships between arbitrary pairs of memory elements, through which a relational memory is constructed from an item memory. The two memories are wired into a single sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning. We achieve competitive results with our proposed two-memory model in a diversity of machine learning tasks, from challenging synthetic problems to practical testbeds such as geometry, graph, reinforcement learning, and question answering.}

  abstract =   {Causal effect identifiability is concerned with establishing the effect of intervening on a set of variables on another set of variables from observational or interventional distributions under causal assumptions that are usually encoded in the form of a causal graph. Most of the results of this literature implicitly assume that every variable modeled in the graph is measured in the available distributions. In practice, however, the data collections of the different studies considered do not measure the same variables, consistently. In this paper, we study the causal effect identifiability problem when the available distributions encompass different sets of variables, which we refer to as identification under partial-observability. We study a number of properties of the factors that comprise a causal effect under various levels of abstraction, and then characterize the relationship between them with respect to their status relative to the identification of a targeted intervention. We establish a sufficient graphical criterion for determining whether the effects are identifiable from partially-observed distributions. Finally, building on these graphical properties, we develop an algorithm that returns a formula for a causal effect in terms of the available distributions.}

Therefore, dimensionality reduction techniques such as low rank approximations (LRA) can be effectively exploited. To achieve this, we develop a novel sparsification algorithm and derive a cost-effective analytical sampler. As a result, we show that the information form can be scalably applied to represent model uncertainty in DNNs. Our exhaustive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on various benchmarks show the competitiveness of our approach over the current methods.}

In this paper, we show that such a technique can be used to significantly improve the model accuracy even under fully-labeled datasets. Our scheme trains the model to learn both original and self-supervised tasks, but is different from conventional multi-task learning frameworks that optimize the summation of their corresponding losses. Our main idea is to learn a single unified task with respect to the joint distribution of the original and self-supervised labels, i.e., we augment original labels via self-supervision. This simple, yet effective approach allows to train models easier by relaxing a certain invariant constraint during learning the original and self-supervised tasks simultaneously. It also enables an aggregated inference which combines the predictions from different augmentations to improve the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique, which we refer to as self-distillation, that has the effect of the aggregated inference in a single (faster) inference. We demonstrate the large accuracy improvement and wide applicability of our framework on various fully-supervised settings, e.g., the few-shot and imbalanced classification scenarios.}

In such a scenario, we want to prevent the optimized policy from deviating too much from the data collection policy since the estimation becomes highly unstable otherwise due to the off-policy nature of the problem. However, imposing this requirement too strongly will result in a policy that merely follows the data collection policy. Unlike prior work where this trade-off is controlled by hand-tuned hyperparameters, we propose a novel batch reinforcement learning approach, batch optimization of policy and hyperparameter (BOPAH), that uses a gradient-based optimization of the hyperparameter using held-out data. We show that BOPAH outperforms other batch reinforcement learning algorithms in tabular and continuous control tasks, by finding a good balance to the trade-off between adhering to the data collection policy and pursuing the possible policy improvement.}

Due to the difficulty of this combinatorial problem, linear programming (LP) relaxations are commonly used to derive specialized message passing algorithms that are often interpreted as coordinate descent on the dual LP. To achieve more desirable computational properties, a number of methods regularize the LP with an entropy term, leading to a class of smooth message passing algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present randomized methods for accelerating these algorithms by leveraging techniques that underlie classical accelerated gradient methods. The proposed algorithms incorporate the familiar steps of standard smooth message passing algorithms, which can be viewed as coordinate minimization steps. We show that these accelerated variants achieve faster rates for finding $\epsilon$-optimal points of the unregularized problem, and, when the LP is tight, we prove that the proposed algorithms recover the true MAP solution in fewer iterations than standard message passing algorithms.}

The main challenge of learning compound tasks is that we have no explicit supervision to learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. To address this challenge, previous imitation learning methods exploit task-specific knowledge, e.g., labeling demonstrations manually or specifying termination conditions for each sub-task. However, the need for task-specific knowledge makes it difficult to scale imitation learning to real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose an imitation learning method that can learn compound tasks without task-specific knowledge. The key idea behind our method is to leverage a self-supervised learning framework to learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. Our work also proposes a task-agnostic regularization technique to prevent unstable switching between sub-tasks, which has been a common degenerate case in previous works. We evaluate our method against several baselines on compound tasks. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on compound tasks, outperforming prior imitation learning methods.}

In order to encode dynamics-specific information into the context latent vector, we introduce a novel loss function that encourages the context latent vector to be useful for predicting both forward and backward dynamics. The proposed method achieves superior generalization ability across various simulated robotics and control tasks, compared to existing RL schemes.}

In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities). To encourage each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes, the clustering is carried out by learning discrete representations that best describe the future outcome distribution based on novel loss functions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.}

Our mean squared error bound enjoys a faster convergence rate than previous results, and we show that the proposed estimator is minimax optimal under the class of low-rank models. Furthermore, the procedure developed serves as an efficient completion method which guarantees consistent recovery of an order-K (d,...,d)-dimensional low-rank tensor using only O(Kd) noisy, quantized observations.

To achieve meshing from the learned implicit functions, existing methods adopt the de-facto standard algorithm of marching cubes; while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the MLPs, due to the discretization nature of marching cubes. Motivated by the knowledge that a ReLU based MLP partitions its input space into a number of linear regions, we identify from these regions analytic cells and faces that are associated with zero-level isosurface of the implicit function, and characterize the conditions under which the identified faces are guaranteed to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. We propose a naturally parallelizable algorithm of analytic marching to exactly recover the mesh captured by a learned MLP. Experiments on deep learning mesh reconstruction verify the advantages of our algorithm over existing ones.}

However, the existing stability analysis requires to impose restrictive assumptions on the boundedness of gradients, smoothness and convexity of loss functions. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of stability and generalization for SGD by substantially relaxing these assumptions. Firstly, we establish stability and generalization for SGD by removing the existing bounded gradient assumptions. The key idea is the introduction of a new stability measure called on-average model stability, for which we develop novel bounds controlled by the risks of SGD iterates. This yields generalization bounds depending on the behavior of the best model, and leads to the first-ever-known fast bounds in the low-noise setting using stability approach. Secondly, the smoothness assumption is relaxed by considering loss functions with Holder continuous (sub)gradients for which we show that optimal bounds are still achieved by balancing computation and stability. To our best knowledge, this gives the first-ever-known stability and generalization bounds for SGD with non-smooth loss functions (e.g., hinge loss). Finally, we study learning problems with (strongly) convex objectives but non-convex loss functions.}

The current literature has largely focused on analyzing the characteristics of network games in the scenario where the structure of the network, which is represented by a graph, is known beforehand. It is often the case, however, that the actions of the players are readily observable while the underlying interaction network remains hidden. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks for learning, from the observations on individual actions, network games with linear-quadratic payoffs, and in particular, the structure of the interaction network. Our frameworks are based on the Nash equilibrium of such games and involve solving a joint optimization problem for the graph structure and the individual marginal benefits. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, which have theoretical as well as practical implications for understanding strategic interactions in a network environment.}

Traditional conditional approaches provide a model for a \emph{fixed} set of covariates conditioned on another \emph{fixed} set of observed covariates. Instead, in this work we develop a model that is capable of yielding \emph{all} conditional distributions $p(x_u \mid x_o)$ (for arbitrary $x_u$) via tractable conditional likelihoods. We propose a novel extension of (change of variables based) flow generative models, arbitrary conditioning flow models (ACFlow). ACFlow can be conditioned on arbitrary subsets of observed covariates, which was previously infeasible. We further extend ACFlow to model the joint distributions $p(x)$ and arbitrary marginal distributions $p(x_u)$. We also apply ACFlow to the imputation of features, and develop a unified platform for both multiple and single imputation by introducing an auxiliary objective that provides a principled single ``best guess'' for flow models. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling arbitrary conditional likelihoods in addition to both single and multiple imputation in synthetic and real-world datasets.}

Our two-stage method first uses an inexact proximal quasi-Newton method to iteratively identify a sequence of low-dimensional manifolds in which the final solution would lie, and restricts the model update within the current manifold to gradually lower the order of the per-round communication cost from the problem dimension to the dimension of the manifold that contains a solution and makes the problem within it smooth. After identifying this manifold, we take superlinear-convergent truncated semismooth Newton steps computed by preconditioned conjugate gradient to largely reduce the communication rounds by improving the convergence rate from the existing linear or sublinear ones to a superlinear rate. Experiments show that our method can be orders of magnitudes lower in the communication cost and an order of magnitude faster in the running time than the state of the art.}

Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods used to discover the optimal neural architecture that best fits the validation examples given the up-to-date network weights. However, back propagation with a number of validation examples could be time consuming, especially when it needs to be repeated many times in NAS. Though these intermediate validation results are invaluable, they would be wasted if we cannot use them to predict the future from the past. In this paper, we propose to approximate the validation loss landscape by learning a mapping from neural architectures to their corresponding validate losses. The optimal neural architecture thus can be easily identified as the minimum of this proxy validation loss landscape. A novel sampling strategy is further developed for an efficient approximation of the loss landscape. Theoretical analysis indicates that the validation loss estimator learnt with our sampling strategy can reach a lower error rate and a lower label complexity compared with a uniform sampling. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that the architecture searched by the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory accuracy with less time cost.}

Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune 97\% parameters and 92\% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and achieve a 44\% reduction in run-time memory consumption and a 53\% reduction in inference latency.}

Although many approaches have been proposed to enhance the robustness of neural networks, few of them explored robust architectures for neural networks. On this account, we try to address such an issue from the perspective of dynamic system in this work. By viewing ResNet as an explicit Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation~(ODE), for the first time, we find that the adversarial robustness of ResNet is connected to the numerical stability of the corresponding dynamic system, i.e., more stable numerical schemes may correspond to more robust deep networks. Furthermore, inspired by the implicit Euler method for solving numerical ODE problems, we propose Implicit Euler skip connections~(IE-Skips) by modifying the original skip connection in ResNet or its variants. Then we theoretically prove its advantages under the adversarial attack and the experimental results show that our ResNet with IE-Skips can largely improve the robustness and the generalization ability under adversarial attacks when compared with the vanilla ResNet of the same parameter size.}

We further interpret the proposed learning framework as maximum likelihood estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and the back-search algorithm as a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The experiments are conducted on two weakly-supervised neural-symbolic tasks: (1) handwritten formula recognition on the newly introduced HWF dataset; (2) visual question answering on the CLEVR dataset. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the RL methods in terms of performance, converging speed, and data efficiency.

  abstract =   {Due to the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning problems, methods relying on compression of communicated messages are becoming increasingly popular. While in other contexts the best performing gradient-type methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the number of iterations, there are no methods which combine the benefits of both gradient compression and acceleration. In this paper, we remedy this situation and propose the first \emph{accelerated compressed gradient descent (ACGD)} methods. In the single machine regime, we prove that ACGD enjoys the rate $O\Big((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\Big)$ for $\mu$-strongly convex problems and $O\Big((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$ for convex problems, respectively, where $\omega$ is the compression parameter. Our results improve upon the existing non-accelerated rates $O\Big((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\mu}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\Big)$ and $O\Big((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\epsilon}\Big)$, respectively, and recover the optimal rates of accelerated gradient descent as a special case when no compression ($\omega=0$) is applied. We further propose a distributed variant of ACGD (called ADIANA) and prove the convergence rate $\widetilde{O}\Big(\omega+\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}+\sqrt{\big(\frac{\omega}{n}+\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{n}}\big)\frac{\omega L}{\mu}}\Big)$, where $n$ is the number of devices/workers and $\widetilde{O}$ hides the logarithmic factor $\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This improves upon the previous best result $\widetilde{O}\Big(\omega + \frac{L}{\mu}+\frac{\omega L}{n\mu} \Big)$ achieved by the DIANA method of Mishchenko et al. (2019). Finally, we conduct several experiments on real-world datasets which corroborate our theoretical results and confirm the practical superiority of our accelerated methods.}

We prove that under certain conditions, a linear combination of quality and diversity constitutes a divergence metric between the generated distribution and the real distribution. We also show that the commonly used BLEU/Self-BLEU metric pair fails to match any divergence metric, thus propose CR/NRR as a substitute for quality/diversity metric pair.}

Furthermore our new model can be applied to autoencoders as a plugin, and works across diverse domains such as images or text. We demonstrate the utility of our method for attribute manipulation in autoencoders trained across varied domains, using both human evaluation and automated methods.

The abilities to perform physical reasoning and to adapt to new environments, while intrinsic to humans, remain challenging to state-of-the-art computational models. In this work, we present a neural model that simultaneously reasons about physics and makes future predictions based on visual and dynamics priors. The visual prior predicts a particle-based representation of the system from visual observations. An inference module operates on those particles, predicting and refining estimates of particle locations, object states, and physical parameters, subject to the constraints imposed by the dynamics prior, which we refer to as visual grounding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in environments involving rigid objects, deformable materials, and fluids. Experiments show that our model can infer the physical properties within a few observations, which allows the model to quickly adapt to unseen scenarios and make accurate predictions into the future.}

In this paper, we consider irregular sampling from the perspective of missing data. We model observed irregularly-sampled time series data as a sequence of index-value pairs sampled from a continuous but unobserved function. We introduce an encoder-decoder framework for learning from such generic indexed sequences. We propose learning methods for this framework based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. For continuous irregularly-sampled time series, we introduce continuous convolutional layers that can efficiently interface with existing neural network architectures. Experiments show that our models are able to achieve competitive or better classification results on irregularly-sampled multivariate time series compared to recent RNN models while offering significantly faster training times.}

In this paper, we claim that the issue can be practically tackled by evolutionary algorithms in an affordable manner. We encode the complex topological structures into binary strings, and develop a simple genetic meta-algorithm to search the optimal topology on Hamming space. The experimental results by both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can effectively discover the ground-truth topology or even better structures with a small number of generations, and significantly boost the representational power of TN decomposition compared with well-known tensor-train (TT) or tensor-ring (TR) models.}

We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations. This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.}

In particular, SVRG, SARAH, and their BB variants are first reexamined through an `estimate sequence' lens to enable new averaging methods that tighten their convergence rates theoretically, and improve their performance empirically when the step size or the inner loop length is chosen large. Then a simple yet effective means to adjust the number of iterations per inner loop is developed to enhance the merits of the proposed averaging schemes and BB step sizes. Numerical tests corroborate the proposed methods.}

We model the dynamics of the event starts and ends via intensity function with the structures informed by a set of first-order temporal logic rules. Using the softened representation of temporal relations, and a weighted combination of logic rules, our probabilistic model can deal with uncertainty in events. Furthermore, many well-known point processes (e.g., Hawkes process, self-correcting point process) can be interpreted as special cases of our model given simple temporal logic rules. Our model, therefore, riches the family of point processes. We derive a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for our model and show that it can lead to accurate predictions when data are sparse and domain knowledge is critical.}

Our algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + n^{\alpha_p}\poly(k/\eps))$, where $\alpha_p = 1$ for $p\in [1,2)$ and $\alpha_p = 1 + (\omega-1)(1-2/p)$ for $p>2$ and $\omega \approx 2.374$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the important case of $p = 1$, which corresponds to the more ``robust'' nuclear norm, we obtain $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + n \cdot \poly(k/\epsilon))$ time, which was previously only known for the Frobenius norm $(p = 2)$. Moreover, since $\alpha_p < \omega$ for every $p$, our algorithm has a better dependence on $n$ than that in the singular value decomposition for every $p$.

In this work, we propose RIFLE - a simple yet effective strategy that deepens backpropagation in transfer learning settings, through periodically ReInitializing the Fully-connected LayEr with random scratch during the fine-tuning procedure. RIFLE brings significant perturbation to the backpropagation process and leads to deep CNN weights update, while the affects of perturbation can be easily converged throughout the overall learning procedure. The experiments show that the use of RIFLE significantly improves deep transfer learning accuracy on a wide range of datasets, outperforming known tricks for the similar purpose, such as dropout, dropconnect, stochastic depth, and cyclic learning rate, under the same settings with 0.5\%-2\% higher testing accuracy. Empirical cases and ablation studies further indicate RIFLE brings meaningful updates to deep CNN layers with accuracy improved.}

We propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework, named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). SHOT freezes the classifier module (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis. To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks.}

In this paper, we explore a technique for accelerating range density estimation over deep autoregressive models. This technique, called variable skipping, exploits the sparse structure of range density queries to avoid sampling unnecessary variables during approximate inference. We show that variable skipping provides 10-100x efficiency improvements when targeting challenging high-quantile error metrics, enables complex applications such as text pattern matching, and can be realized via a simple data augmentation procedure without changing the usual maximum likelihood objective.}

A DMFB, composed of a two-dimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as point-of-care clinical diagnosis. However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay outcome. We show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of electrodes and to provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RL-based droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet-routing problems on DMFBs.}

Amortization allows us to significantly reduce the error of the gradient approximator by approaching asymptotic optimality of a regular DAE, in which case the estimation is in theory unbiased. We conduct theoretical and experimental analyses on the approximation error of the proposed method, as well as extensive studies on heuristics to ensure its robustness. Finally, using the proposed gradient approximator to estimate the gradient of entropy, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on density estimation with variational autoencoders and continuous control with soft actor-critic.}

The activation regions of the network partition the input space, and one can verify the ℓp robustness around a point by checking all the activation regions within the desired radius. The GeoCert algorithm (Jordan et al., NeurIPS 2019) treats this partition as a generic polyhedral complex in order to detect which region to check next. In contrast, our LayerCert framework considers the nested hyperplane arrangement structure induced by the layers of the ReLU network and explores regions in a hierarchical manner. We show that, under certain conditions on the algorithm parameters, LayerCert provably reduces the number and size of the convex programs that one needs to solve compared to GeoCert. Furthermore, our LayerCert framework allows the incorporation of lower bounding routines based on convex relaxations to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LayerCert can significantly reduce both the number of convex programs solved and the running time over the state-of-the-art.}

One of the most popular algorithms for solving this problem is the celebrated gradient descent ascent (GDA) algorithm, which has been widely used in machine learning, control theory and economics. Despite the extensive convergence results for the convex-concave setting, GDA with equal stepsize can converge to limit cycles or even diverge in a general setting. In this paper, we present the complexity results on two-time-scale GDA for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems, showing that the algorithm can find a stationary point of the function $\Phi(\cdot) := \max_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\cdot, \mathbf{y})$ efficiently. To the best our knowledge, this is the first nonasymptotic analysis for two-time-scale GDA in this setting, shedding light on its superior practical performance in training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other real applications.}

  abstract =   {Deep learning networks are typically trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods that iteratively improve the model parameters by estimating a gradient on a very small fraction of the training data. A major roadblock faced when increasing the batch size to a substantial fraction of the training data for reducing training time is the persistent degradation in performance (generalization gap). To address this issue, recent work propose to add small perturbations to the model parameters when computing the stochastic gradients and report improved generalization performance due to smoothing effects. However, this approach is poorly understood; it requires often model-specific noise and fine-tuning. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to use instead computationally efficient extrapolation (extragradient) to stabilize the optimization trajectory while still benefiting from smoothing to avoid sharp minima. This principled approach is well grounded from an optimization perspective and we show that a host of variations can be covered in a unified framework that we propose. We prove the convergence of this novel scheme and rigorously evaluate its empirical performance on ResNet, LSTM, and Transformer. We demonstrate that in a variety of experiments the scheme allows scaling to much larger batch sizes than before whilst reaching or surpassing SOTA accuracy.}

In this work, we address this issue for positive-definite constraints by proposing an improved rule that naturally handles the constraints. Our modification is obtained by using Riemannian gradient methods, and is valid when the approximation attains a block-coordinate natural parameterization (e.g., Gaussian distributions and their mixtures). Our method outperforms existing methods without any significant increase in computation. Our work makes it easier to apply the rule in the presence of positive-definite constraints in parameter spaces.}

Recent advances have been dominated by Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based methods, while training disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) remains challenging. In this work, we show that the dominant challenges facing disentangled GANs can be mitigated through the use of self-supervision. We make two main contributions: first, we design a novel approach for training disentangled GANs with self-supervision. We propose contrastive regularizer, which is inspired by a natural notion of disentanglement: latent traversal. This achieves higher disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art VAE- and GAN-based approaches. Second, we propose an unsupervised model selection scheme called ModelCentrality, which uses generated synthetic samples to compute the medoid (multi-dimensional generalization of median) of a collection of models. The current common practice of hyper-parameter tuning requires using ground-truths samples, each labelled with known perfect disentangled latent codes. As real datasets are not equipped with such labels, we propose an unsupervised model selection scheme and show that it finds a model close to the best one, for both VAEs and GANs. Combining contrastive regularization with ModelCentrality, we improve upon the state-of-the-art disentanglement scores significantly, without accessing the supervised data.}

Second, despite using generative objectives, abilities for object detection and tracking are mainly investigated, leaving the crucial ability of temporal imagination largely under question. Third, a few key abilities for more faithful temporal imagination such as multimodal uncertainty and situation-awareness are missing. In this paper, we introduce Generative Structured World Models (G-SWM). The G-SWM achieves the versatile world modeling not only by unifying the key properties of previous models in a principled framework but also by achieving two crucial new abilities, multimodal uncertainty and situation-awareness. Our thorough investigation on the temporal generation ability in comparison to the previous models demonstrates that G-SWM achieves the versatility with the best or comparable performance for all experiment settings including a few complex settings that have not been tested before. https://sites.google.com/view/gswm}

These new techniques have the potential to trigger a paradigm shift, where, it is possible to construct sparse decision trees to efficiently optimize a variety of objective functions, without relying on greedy splitting and pruning heuristics that often lead to suboptimal solutions. The contribution in this work is to provide a general framework for decision tree optimization that addresses the two significant open problems in the area: treatment of imbalanced data and fully optimizing over continuous variables. We present techniques that produce optimal decision trees over variety of objectives including F-score, AUC, and partial area under the ROC convex hull.

Subsequently, we extend OGD learning to the noisy gradient feedback case and establish last-iterate convergence results--first qualitative almost sure convergence, then quantitative finite-time convergence rates-- all under non-decreasing step-sizes. To our knowledge, we provide the first set of results that fill in several gaps of the existing multi-agent online learning literature, where three aspects--finite-time convergence rates, non-decreasing step-sizes, and fully adaptive algorithms have been unexplored before.}

Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\cdot}n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale standard machine translation, abstractive summarization and language modeling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other attention/convolution based approaches.}

We analyze the variance of the most popular approaches through the viewpoint of conditional Monte Carlo. Surprisingly, we find that in finite horizon MDPs there is no strict variance reduction of per-decision importance sampling or marginalized importance sampling, comparing with vanilla importance sampling. We then provide sufficient conditions under which the per-decision or marginalized estimators will provably reduce the variance over importance sampling with finite horizons. For the asymptotic (in terms of horizon $T$) case, we develop upper and lower bounds on the variance of those estimators which yields sufficient conditions under which there exists an exponential v.s. polynomial gap between the variance of importance sampling and that of the per-decision or stationary/marginalized estimators. These results help advance our understanding of if and when new types of IS estimators will improve the accuracy of off-policy estimation.}

Meanwhile, in these feature selection models, the interactions between features are often ignored or just discussed under prior structure information. To address these challenging issues, we consider the problem of sparse additive models for high-dimensional nonparametric regression with the allowance of the flexible interactions between features. A new method, called as sparse shrunk additive models (SSAM), is proposed to explore the structure information among features. This method bridges sparse kernel regression and sparse feature selection. Theoretical results on the convergence rate and sparsity characteristics of SSAM are established by the novel analysis techniques with integral operator and concentration estimate. In particular, our algorithm and theoretical analysis only require the component functions to be continuous and bounded, which are not necessary to be in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

We propose a big-little dual-module inference to dynamically skip unnecessary memory accesses and computations to accelerate DNN inference. Leveraging the noise-resilient feature of nonlinear activation functions, we propose to use a lightweight little module that approximates the original DNN layer, termed as the big module, to compute activations of the insensitive region that are more noise-resilient. Hence, the expensive memory accesses and computations of the big module can be reduced as the results are only calculated in the sensitive region. For memory-bound models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), our method can reduce the overall memory accesses by 40\% on average and achieve 1.54x to 1.75x speedup on a commodity CPU-based server platform with a negligible impact on model quality. In addition, our method can reduce the operations of the compute-bound models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by 3.02x, with only a 0.5\% accuracy drop.}

We first consider noiseless 1-bit measurements, and provide sample complexity bounds for approximate recovery under i.i.d.~Gaussian measurements and a Lipschitz continuous generative prior, as well as a near-matching algorithm-independent lower bound. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Binary $\epsilon$-Stable Embedding property, which characterizes the robustness of the reconstruction to measurement errors and noise, also holds for 1-bit compressive sensing with Lipschitz continuous generative models with sufficiently many Gaussian measurements.

In this work, we introduce a new family of loss functions that we name as peer loss functions, which enables learning from noisy labels and does not require a priori specification of the noise rates. Peer loss functions work within the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. We show that, under mild conditions, performing ERM with peer loss functions on the noisy data leads to the optimal or a near-optimal classifier as if performing ERM over the clean training data, which we do not have access to. We pair our results with an extensive set of experiments. Peer loss provides a way to simplify model development when facing potentially noisy training labels, and can be promoted as a robust candidate loss function in such situations.}

  abstract =   {Program execution speed critically depends on increasing cache hits, as cache hits are orders of magnitude faster than misses. To increase cache hits, we focus on the problem of cache replacement: choosing which cache line to evict upon inserting a new line. This is challenging because it requires planning far ahead and currently there is no known practical solution. As a result, current replacement policies typically resort to heuristics designed for specific common access patterns, which fail on more diverse and complex access patterns. In contrast, we propose an imitation learning approach to automatically learn cache access patterns by leveraging Belady's, an oracle policy that computes the optimal eviction decision given the future cache accesses. While directly applying Belady's is infeasible since the future is unknown, we train a policy conditioned only on past accesses that accurately approximates Belady's even on diverse and complex access patterns, and call this approach Parrot. When evaluated on 13 of the most memory-intensive SPEC applications, Parrot increases cache miss rates by 20\% over the current state of the art. In addition, on a large-scale web search benchmark, Parrot increases cache hit rates by 61\% over a conventional LRU policy. We release a Gym environment to facilitate research in this area, as data is plentiful, and further advancements can have significant real-world impact.}

Most previous works on VP approached the problem by planning in a learned latent space, resulting in low-quality visual plans, and difficult training algorithms. Here, instead, we propose a simple VP method that plans directly in image space and displays competitive performance. We build on the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method: image samples are treated as nodes in a graph, the graph connectivity is learned from image sequence data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. We propose two modifications on SPTM. First, we train an energy-based graph connectivity function using contrastive predictive coding that admits stable training. Second, to allow zero-shot planning in new domains, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates images given a context describing the domain, and use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph and planning. We show that this simple approach significantly outperform the SOTA VP methods, in terms of both plan interpretability and success rate when using the plan to guide a trajectory-following controller. Interestingly, our method can pick up non-trivial visual properties of objects, such as their geometry, and account for it in the plans.}

In this paper, we formulate the sequence optimization task as a chance-constrained optimization problem. The key idea is to enforce a high probability of generating valid sequences and also optimize the property of interest.

  abstract =   {In this paper, we consider matrix completion with absolute deviation loss and obtain an estimator of the median matrix. Despite several appealing properties of median, the non-smooth absolute deviation loss leads to computational challenge for large-scale data sets which are increasingly common among matrix completion problems. A simple solution to large-scale problems is parallel computing. However, embarrassingly parallel fashion often leads to inefficient estimators. Based on the idea of pseudo data, we propose a novel refinement step, which turns such inefficient estimators into a rate (near-)optimal matrix completion procedure. The refined estimator is an approximation of a regularized least median estimator, and therefore not an ordinary regularized empirical risk estimator. This leads to a non-standard analysis of asymptotic behaviors. Empirical results are also provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

  abstract =   {In recent years, a variety of gradient-based bi-level optimization methods have been developed for learning tasks. However, theoretical guarantees of these existing approaches often heavily rely on the simplification that for each fixed upper-level variable, the lower-level solution must be a singleton (a.k.a., Lower-Level Singleton, LLS). In this work, by formulating bi-level models from the optimistic viewpoint and aggregating hierarchical objective information, we establish Bi-level Descent Aggregation (BDA), a flexible and modularized algorithmic framework for bi-level programming. Theoretically, we derive a new methodology to prove the convergence of BDA without the LLS condition. Furthermore, we improve the convergence properties of conventional first-order bi-level schemes (under the LLS simplification) based on our proof recipe. Extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BDA for different tasks, including hyper-parameter optimization and meta learning.}

Our tests are constructed from kernels parameterized by deep neural nets, trained to maximize test power. These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and shape over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex data. By contrast, the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are spatially homogeneous, and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this scheme includes popular classifier-based two-sample tests as a special case, but improves on them in general. We provide the first proof of consistency for the proposed adaptation method, which applies both to kernels on deep features and to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple kernel learning. In experiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep kernels in hypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data.

  abstract =   {We introduce a new way of learning to encode position information for non-recurrent models, such as Transformer models. Unlike RNN and LSTM, which contain inductive bias by loading the input tokens sequentially, non-recurrent models are less sensitive to position. The main reason is that position information among input units is not encoded inherently, i.e., they are permutation equivalent, this problem justifies why all of the existing models are accompanied by position encoding/embedding layer at the input. However, this solution has clear limitations: the sinusoidal position encoding is not flexible enough as it is manually designed and does not contain any learnable parameters, whereas the position embedding restricts the maximum length of input sequences. It is thus desirable to design a new position layer that contains learnable parameters to adjust to different datasets and different architectures. At the same time, we would also like it to extrapolate in accordance with the variable length of inputs. In our proposed solution, we borrow from the recent Neural ODE approach, which may be viewed as a versatile continuous version of a ResNet. This model is capable of modeling many kinds of dynamical systems. We model the evolution of encoded results along position index by such a dynamical system, thereby overcoming the above limitations of existing methods. We evaluate our new position layers on a variety of neural machine translation and language understanding tasks, the experimental results show consistent improvements over the baselines.}

In this article, we introduce Neural Tangent Transfer, a method that instead finds trainable sparse networks in a label-free manner. Specifically, we find sparse networks whose training dynamics, as characterized by the neural tangent kernel, mimic those of dense networks in function space. Finally, we evaluate our label-agnostic approach on several standard classification tasks and show that the resulting sparse networks achieve higher classification performance while converging faster.}

Second, we provide practical algorithms that learn disentangled representations from pairs of images without requiring annotation of groups, individual factors, or the number of factors that have changed. Third, we perform a large-scale empirical study and show that such pairs of observations are sufficient to reliably learn disentangled representations on several benchmark data sets. Finally, we evaluate our learned representations and find that they are simultaneously useful on a diverse suite of tasks, including generalization under covariate shifts, fairness, and abstract reasoning. Overall, our results demonstrate that weak supervision enables learning of useful disentangled representations in realistic scenarios.}

Using tools from the optimization literature we show that SHGD converges linearly to the neighbourhood of a stationary point. To guarantee convergence to the exact solution, we analyze SHGD with a decreasing step-size and we also present the first stochastic variance reduced Hamiltonian method. Our results provide the first global non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for the class of stochastic unconstrained bilinear games and for the more general class of stochastic games that satisfy a ``sufficiently bilinear" condition, notably including some non-convex non-concave problems. We supplement our analysis with experiments on stochastic bilinear and sufficiently bilinear games, where our theory is shown to be tight, and on simple adversarial machine learning formulations.}

However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is that the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are from the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical worst-case error bounds, which may not account for the unique structure of a given problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads to much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. Furthermore, the method is computationally inexpensive, because it operates only on sketched objects, and hence it requires no extra passes over the full matrix being factored.}

In this paper, we show how to differentiate through the Fr{\'e}chet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr{\'e}chet mean solver. This fully integrates the Fr{\'e}chet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our Fr{\'e}chet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr{\'e}chet mean's capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the one observed in the Euclidean setting.}

We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG's Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored.}

Moniqua improves upon prior works in that it (1) requires zero additional memory, (2) works with 1-bit quantization, and (3) is applicable to a variety of decentralized algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that Moniqua converges faster with respect to wall clock time than other quantized decentralized algorithms. We also show that Moniqua is robust to very low bit-budgets, allowing $1$-bit-per-parameter communication without compromising validation accuracy when training ResNet20 and ResNet110 on CIFAR10.}

To understand the success of SGD for training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-field analysis of deep residual networks, based on a line of works which interpret the continuum limit of the deep residual network as an ordinary differential equation as the the network capacity tends to infinity. Specifically, we propose a \textbf{new continuum limit} of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in the sense that \textbf{every local minimizer is global}. This characterization enables us to derive the first global convergence result for multilayer neural networks in the mean-field regime. Furthermore, our proof does not rely on the convexity of the loss landscape, but instead, an assumption on the global minimizer should achieve zero loss which can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property. Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles a shallow network ensemble~\cite{veit2016residual}, \emph{i.e.} a two-layer network. We bound the difference between the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivity method, which enables us to transfer previous mean-field analysis of two-layer networks to deep networks. Furthermore, we propose several novel training schemes based on our new continuous model, among which one new training procedure introduces the operation of switching the order of the residual blocks and results in strong empirical performance on benchmark datasets.}

Nevertheless, as soon as the agents are finetuned to maximize task completion, they suffer from the so-called language drift phenomenon: they slowly lose syntactic and semantic properties of language as they only focus on solving the task. In this paper, we propose a generic approach to counter language drift called Seeded iterated learning (SIL). We periodically refine a pretrained student agent by imitating data sampled from a newly generated teacher agent. At each time step, the teacher is created by copying the student agent, before being finetuned to maximize task completion. SIL does not require external syntactic constraint nor semantic knowledge, making it a valuable task-agnostic finetuning protocol. We evaluate SIL in a toy-setting Lewis Game, and then scale it up to the translation game with natural language. In both settings, SIL helps counter language drift as well as it improves the task completion compared to baselines.}

While label smoothing apparently amplifies this problem --- being equivalent to injecting symmetric noise to the labels --- we show how it relates to a general family of loss-correction techniques from the label noise literature. Building on this connection, we show that label smoothing is competitive with loss-correction under label noise. Further, we show that when distilling models from noisy data, label smoothing of the teacher is beneficial; this is in contrast to recent findings for noise-free problems, and sheds further light on settings where label smoothing is beneficial.}

Given a constant $d\ge 1$ and a graph of $n$ nodes, the state-of-the-art approach, Radar-Push, uses $O(\log\log{n}+\log{d})$ communication rounds to approximate the PageRanks within a relative error $\Theta(\frac{1}{\log^d{n}})$ under a generalized congested clique distributed computation model. However, Radar-Push entails as large as $O(\log^{2d+3}{n})$ bits of bandwidth (e.g., the communication cost between a pair of nodes per round).

In this paper, we tackle a more realistic problem of the "open-set" domain shift where the target data contains additional classes that were not present in the source data. More specifically, we introduce an end-to-end Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework where a graph neural network with episodic training is integrated to suppress underlying conditional shift and adversarial learning is adopted to close the gap between the source and target distributions. Compared to the existing open-set adaptation approaches, our approach guarantees to achieve a tighter upper bound of the target error.

Different from the traditional NMF models which focus on either the regular input or certain types of noise, our model considers potential test adversaries that are beyond the pre-defined constraints, which can cope with various noises (or perturbations). We formulate the proposed model as a bilevel optimization problem and use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve it with convergence analysis. Theoretically, the robustness analysis of ANMF is established under mild conditions dedicating asymptotically unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments verify that ANMF is robust to a broad categories of perturbations, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on distinct real-world benchmark datasets.}

Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG, demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system solvers.}

  abstract =   {Partial-label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem, where each training instance is equipped with a set of candidate labels among which only one is the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed learning objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in specific manners, making their computational complexity a bottleneck for scaling up to big data. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework of PLL with flexibility on the model and optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a novel estimator of the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and establish an estimation error bound. Then we propose a progressive identification algorithm for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator, where the update of the model and identification of true labels are conducted in a seamless manner. The resulting algorithm is model-independent and loss-independent, and compatible with stochastic optimization. Thorough experiments demonstrate it sets the new state of the art.}

Our model captures display advertising where the "click-through-rate" can be decomposed to a (fixed across time) arm-quality component and a non-stochastic user-relevance component (fixed across arms). Despite the relative stochasticity of our model, we demonstrate two settings where most bandit algorithms suffer. On the positive side, we show that two algorithms, one from the action elimination and one from the mirror descent family are adaptive enough to be robust to adversarial scaling. Our results shed light on the robustness of adaptive parameter selection in stochastic bandits, which may be of independent interest.}

Recent papers introduced the concept of Pareto optimality to this field and directly cast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization problems, but solutions returned by existing methods are typically finite, sparse, and discrete. We present a novel, efficient method that generates locally continuous Pareto sets and Pareto fronts, which opens up the possibility of continuous analysis of Pareto optimal solutions in machine learning problems. We scale up theoretical results in multi-objective optimization to modern machine learning problems by proposing a sample-based sparse linear system, for which standard Hessian-free solvers in machine learning can be applied. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate its usage of analyzing local Pareto sets on various multi-task classification and regression problems. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm reveals the primary directions in local Pareto sets for trade-off balancing, finds more solutions with different trade-offs efficiently, and scales well to tasks with millions of parameters.}

It has been shown that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that: \emph{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a problem of \emph{underfitting}. To address this, we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called \emph{Active Passive Loss} (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the family of new loss functions created by our APL framework can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, especially under large noise rates such as 60\% or 80\% incorrect labels.}

This paper proposes a class of subgradient methods for constrained optimization where the objective function and the constraint functions are weakly convex and nonsmooth. Our methods solve a sequence of strongly convex subproblems, where a quadratic regularization term is added to both the objective function and each constraint function. Each subproblem can be solved by various algorithms for strongly convex optimization. Under a uniform Slater's condition, we establish the computation complexities of our methods for finding a nearly stationary point.}

In this work, we introduce model incoherence to characterize the diversity of model characteristics and study its impact on convergence of SGD with random reshuffle under weak strong convexity. Specifically, minimizer incoherence measures the discrepancy between the global minimizers of a sample loss and those of the total loss and affects the convergence error of SGD with random reshuffle. In particular, we show that the variable sequence generated by SGD with random reshuffle converges to a certain global minimizer of the total loss under full minimizer coherence. The other curvature incoherence measures the quality of condition numbers of the sample losses and determines the convergence rate of SGD. With model incoherence, our results show that SGD has a faster convergence rate and smaller convergence error under random reshuffle than those under random sampling, and hence provide justifications to the superior practical performance of SGD with random reshuffle.}

In this paper, we conjecture that the leading cause of adversarial vulnerability is the distortion in the latent feature space, and provide methods to suppress them effectively. Explicitly, we define \emph{vulnerability} for each latent feature and then propose a new loss for adversarial learning, \emph{Vulnerability Suppression (VS)} loss, that aims to minimize the feature-level vulnerability during training. We further propose a Bayesian framework to prune features with high vulnerability to reduce both vulnerability and loss on adversarial samples. We validate our \emph{Adversarial Neural Pruning with Vulnerability Suppression (ANP-VS)} method on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it not only obtains state-of-the-art adversarial robustness but also improves the performance on clean examples, using only a fraction of the parameters used by the full network. Further qualitative analysis suggests that the improvements come from the suppression of feature-level vulnerability.}

A common requirement in MTL applications, that cannot be addressed by these methods, is to find a solution satisfying userspecified preferences with respect to task-specific losses. We advance the state-of-the-art by developing the first gradient-based multi-objective MTL algorithm to solve this problem. Our unique approach combines multiple gradient descent with carefully controlled ascent to traverse the Pareto front in a principled manner, which also makes it robust to initialization. The scalability of our algorithm enables its use in large-scale deep networks for MTL. Assuming only differentiability of the task-specific loss functions, we provide theoretical guarantees for convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the best competing methods on benchmark datasets.}

Here, we propose general methods for reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce contextual effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of these effects, and identifies sets of these inputs with similar properties. Additionally, we analyze contextual effects related to differential processing of the beginning and end of documents. Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual modification, recovering greater than 90\% of the RNN's performance increase over the baseline. This work yields a new understanding of how RNNs process contextual information, and provides tools that should provide similar insight more broadly.}

We therefore propose a simple scheme for stabilization that combines the global worst-case guarantees of proximal gradient methods with the local adaptation and practical speed-up of Anderson acceleration.

Our key innovation is the construction of a special Lyapunov function for which the proven complexity can be achieved without any tuning of the momentum parameter.

While most work has defended against a single type of attack, recent work has looked at defending against multiple perturbation models using simple aggregations of multiple attacks. However, these methods can be difficult to tune, and can easily result in imbalanced degrees of robustness to individual perturbation models, resulting in a sub-optimal worst-case loss over the union. In this work, we develop a natural generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure to incorporate multiple perturbation models into a single attack, by taking the worst-case over all steepest descent directions. This approach has the advantage of directly converging upon a trade-off between different perturbation models which minimizes the worst-case performance over the union. With this approach, we are able to train standard architectures which are simultaneously robust against $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_1$ attacks, outperforming past approaches on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and achieving adversarial accuracy of 47.0\% against the union of ($\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$) perturbations with radius = (0.03, 0.5, 12) on the latter, improving upon previous approaches which achieve 40.6\% accuracy.}

Training policies solely on the team-based reward is often difficult due to its sparsity. Also, relying solely on the agent-specific reward is sub-optimal because it usually does not capture the team coordination objective. A common approach is to use reward shaping to construct a proxy reward by combining the individual rewards. However, this requires manual tuning for each environment. We introduce Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL), a split-level training platform that handles the two objectives separately through two optimization processes. An evolutionary algorithm maximizes the sparse team-based objective through neuroevolution on a population of teams. Concurrently, a gradient-based optimizer trains policies to only maximize the dense agent-specific rewards. The gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary population as a way of information transfer between the two optimization processes. This enables the evolutionary algorithm to use skills learned via the agent-specific rewards toward optimizing the global objective. Results demonstrate that MERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as MADDPG, on a number of difficult coordination benchmarks.}

We show that, in such cases, we can improve sample efficiency by estimating simple functions that bound these outcomes instead of estimating their conditional expectations, which may be complex and hard to estimate. Our analysis highlights a trade-off between the complexity of the learning task and the confidence with which the learned bounds hold. Guided by these findings, we develop an algorithm for learning upper and lower bounds on potential outcomes which optimize an objective function defined by the decision maker, subject to the probability that bounds are violated being small. Using a clinical dataset and a well-known causality benchmark, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines, providing tighter, more reliable bounds.}

Guided by the optimal transport theory, we learn the optimal Kantorovich potential which induces the optimal transport map. This involves learning two convex functions, by solving a novel minimax optimization. Building upon recent advances in the field of input convex neural networks, we propose a new framework to estimate the optimal transport mapping as the gradient of a convex function that is trained via minimax optimization. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the learned transport map. Our approach can be readily used to train a deep generative model. When trained between a simple distribution in the latent space and a target distribution, the learned optimal transport map acts as a deep generative model. Although scaling this to a large dataset is challenging, we demonstrate two important strengths over standard adversarial training: robustness and discontinuity. As we seek the optimal transport, the learned generative model provides the same mapping regardless of how we initialize the neural networks. Further, a gradient of a neural network can easily represent discontinuous mappings, unlike standard neural networks that are constrained to be continuous. This allows the learned transport map to match any target distribution with many discontinuous supports and achieve sharp boundaries.}

  abstract =   {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown much empirical success in solving perceptual tasks across various cognitive modalities. While they are only loosely inspired by the biological brain, recent studies report considerable similarities between representations extracted from task-optimized DNNs and neural populations in the brain. DNNs have subsequently become a popular model class to infer computational principles underlying complex cognitive functions, and in turn, they have also emerged as a natural testbed for applying methods originally developed to probe information in neural populations. In this work, we utilize mean-field theoretic manifold analysis, a recent technique from computational neuroscience that connects geometry of feature representations with linear separability of classes, to analyze language representations from large-scale contextual embedding models. We explore representations from different model families (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, etc.) and find evidence for emergence of linguistic manifolds across layer depth (e.g., manifolds for part-of-speech tags), especially in ambiguous data (i.e, words with multiple part-of-speech tags, or part-of-speech classes including many words). In addition, we find that the emergence of linear separability in these manifolds is driven by a combined reduction of manifolds' radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.}

Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric Elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds.}

Instead of selecting actions according to a single statistic, we propose a distributional method based on the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation. This compares the inherent dispersion of random returns induced by actions, producing a comprehensive evaluation of the environment's uncertainty. The necessary conditions for SSD require estimators to predict accurate second moments. To accommodate this, we map the distributional RL problem to a Wasserstein gradient flow, treating the distributional Bellman residual as a potential energy functional. We propose a particle-based algorithm for which we prove optimality and convergence. Our experiments characterize the algorithm's performance and demonstrate how uncertainty and performance are better balanced using an SSD policy than with other risk measures.}

We provide a simple optimization algorithm compatible with deep neural networks to satisfy these constraints. Since our method does not require test-time access to sensitive attributes, it can be applied to reduce worst-case classification errors between outcomes in unbalanced classification problems. We test the proposed methodology on real case-studies of predicting income, ICU patient mortality, skin lesions classification, and assessing credit risk, demonstrating how our framework compares favorably to other approaches.}

We apply our tools to measure predictive multiplicity in recidivism prediction problems. Our results show that real-world datasets may admit competing models that assign wildly conflicting predictions, and motivate the need to report predictive multiplicity in model development.}

In this work, we consider a task that requires difficult-to-obtain expert annotations: tumor segmentation in mammography images. We show that, in low-data settings, performance can be improved by complementing the expert annotations with seemingly uninformative labels from non-expert annotators, turning the task into a multi-class problem. We reveal that these gains increase when less expert data is available, and uncover several interesting properties through further studies.

That is the premise of recent method of moments algorithms devised for HMMs. In these, correlations between consecutive pair- or triplet-wise observations are empirically estimated and used to compute estimates of the HMM parameters. Albeit computationally very attractive, the main drawback is that by restricting to only low-order correlations in the data, information is being neglected which results in a loss of accuracy (compared to standard maximum likelihood schemes). In this paper, we propose extending these methods (both pair- and triplet-based) by also including non-consecutive correlations in a way which does not significantly increase the computational cost (which scales linearly with the number of additional lags included). We prove strong consistency of the new methods, and demonstrate an improved performance in numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world financial time-series datasets.}

In practice, this limitation is alleviated by making use of approximate sampling methods, yet provably incorporating approximate samples into Thompson Sampling algorithms remains an open problem. In this work we address this by proposing two efficient Langevin MCMC algorithms tailored to Thompson sampling. The resulting approximate Thompson Sampling algorithms are efficiently implementable and provably achieve optimal instance-dependent regret for the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. To prove these results we derive novel posterior concentration bounds and MCMC convergence rates for log-concave distributions which may be of independent interest.}

Training an unrestricted neural model might overfit to spurious patterns. To exploit domain-specific knowledge of how past events might affect an event's present probability, we propose using a temporal deductive database to track structured facts over time. Rules serve to prove facts from other facts and from past events. Each fact has a time-varying state---a vector computed by a neural net whose topology is determined by the fact's provenance, including its experience of past events. The possible event types at any time are given by special facts, whose probabilities are neurally modeled alongside their states. In both synthetic and real-world domains, we show that neural probabilistic models derived from concise Datalog programs improve prediction by encoding appropriate domain knowledge in their architecture.}

First, we show that with the true gradient, policy gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate, with constants depending on the problem and initialization. This result significantly expands the recent asymptotic convergence results. The analysis relies on two findings: that the softmax policy gradient satisfies a \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum probability of an optimal action during optimization can be bounded in terms of its initial value. Second, we analyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show that it enjoys a significantly faster linear convergence rate $O(e^{-t})$ toward softmax optimal policy. This result resolves an open question in the recent literature. Finally, combining the above two results and additional new $\Omega(1/t)$ lower bound results, we explain how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate. The separation of rates is further explained using the notion of non-uniform \L{}ojasiewicz degree. These results provide a theoretical understanding of the impact of entropy and corroborate existing empirical studies.}

We formulate certainty-equivalent expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation. The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter. By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches.

We provide a theoretical analysis that accurately characterizes the expected convergence gains of repartitioning and validate our findings empirically on various traditional machine learning tasks. From an implementation perspective, block-separable models are well suited for parallelization and, when shared memory is available, randomization can be implemented on top of existing methods very efficiently to improve convergence.}

This raises the question: are there principled approaches which justify such methods? In this paper, we propose such an approach using the Bayesian learning rule. The rule, when applied to estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights, results in an algorithm which justifies some of the algorithmic choices made by the previous approaches. The algorithm not only obtains state-of-the-art performance, but also enables uncertainty estimation and continual learning to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides a principled approach for training binary neural networks which also justifies and extends existing approaches.}

The form of the query allows for feedback that is natural for a human to give, and which enables interaction. This is demonstrated in a user experiment in which the user feedback comes in the form of optimal position and orientation of a molecule adsorbing to a surface.

Our causal perspective clearly distinguishes between gaming and improvement and reveals an important obstacle to incentive design. We prove any procedure for designing classifiers that incentivize improvement must inevitably solve a non-trivial causal inference problem.

Much work has gone into identifying such "shortcut" features and hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general framework for mitigating the effect shortcut features. Our key assumption is that those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and datasets by training a "lens" network to make small image changes that maximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with the modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases. Additionally, the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of pretext task and dataset affects the features learned by self-supervision.}

These neuro-symbolic models can induce interpretable rules and learn representations from data via back-propagation, while providing logical explanations for their predictions. However, they are restricted by their computational complexity, as they need to consider all possible proof paths for explaining a goal, thus rendering them unfit for large-scale applications. We present Conditional Theorem Provers (CTPs), an extension to NTPs that learns an optimal rule selection strategy via gradient-based optimisation. We show that CTPs are scalable and yield state-of-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which tests systematic generalisation of neural models by learning to reason over smaller graphs and evaluating on larger ones. Finally, CTPs show better link prediction results on standard benchmarks in comparison with other neural-symbolic models, while being explainable.}

Despite the sustained effort to make IG methods more data-efficient, it remains an open question how to select a training data subset that can theoretically and practically perform on par with the full dataset. Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models. Our extensive set of experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same solution, speeds up various IG methods by up to 6x for logistic regression and 3x for training deep neural networks.}

The algorithm provably explores the environment with sample complexity scaling polynomially in the number of latent states and the time horizon, and, crucially, with no dependence on the size of the observation space, which could be infinitely large. This exploration guarantee further enables sample-efficient global policy optimization for any reward function. On the computational side, we show that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently whenever certain supervised learning problems are tractable.

Top-down signals consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and the current reportable short-term memory, such as how the phrase `peanut butter and ...' will be completed. The optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open question, but the manner of combination must be dynamic and both context and task dependent. To effectively utilize the wealth of potential top-down information available, and to prevent the cacophony of intermixed signals in a bidirectional architecture, mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow. We explore deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention. Modularity of the architecture further restricts the sharing and communication of information. Together, attention and modularity direct information flow, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image classification, video prediction and reinforcement learning that the \emph{bidirectional} information flow can improve results over strong baselines.}

In realistic settings, this is often not true -- the dynamics of an RS ecosystem couple the long-term utility of all agents. In this work, we explore settings in which content providers cannot remain viable unless they receive a certain level of user engagement. We formulate this problem as one of equilibrium selection in the induced dynamical system, and show that it can be solved as an optimal constrained matching problem. Our model ensures the system reaches an equilibrium with maximal social welfare supported by a sufficiently diverse set of viable providers. We demonstrate that even in a simple, stylized dynamical RS model, the standard myopic approach to recommendation - always matching a user to the best provider - performs poorly. We develop several scalable techniques to solve the matching problem, and also draw connections to various notions of user regret and fairness, arguing that these outcomes are fairer in a utilitarian sense.}

On the other hand, mathematical analysis of dynamical systems inferred from data is often more convenient and enables additional insights if these are formulated in continuous time, i.e. as systems of ordinary or partial differential equations (ODE/ PDE). Here we show how to perform such a translation from discrete to continuous time for a particular class of ReLU-based RNN. We prove three theorems on the mathematical equivalence between the discrete and continuous time formulations under a variety of conditions, and illustrate how to use our mathematical results on different machine learning and nonlinear dynamical systems examples.}

Several interpretations are thus drawn for the learned distance-like model's output. We first show it approximates a likelihood ratio which can be used for hypothesis tests, and that it further induces a large divergence across the joint distributions of pairs of examples from the same and from different classes. Evaluation is performed under the verification setting consisting of determining whether sets of examples belong to the same class, even if such classes are novel and were never presented to the model during training. Empirical evaluation shows such method defines an end-to-end approach for the verification problem, able to attain better performance than simple scorers such as those based on cosine similarity and further outperforming widely used downstream classifiers. We further observe training is much simplified under the proposed approach compared to metric learning with actual distances, requiring no complex scheme to harvest pairs of examples.}

Many recent works have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but most of them require either additional computational costs in training and/or inference phases or customized architectures to output confidence estimates separately. In this paper, we propose a method of training deep neural networks with a novel loss function, named Correctness Ranking Loss, which regularizes class probabilities explicitly to be better confidence estimates in terms of ordinal ranking according to confidence. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to the existing architectures without any modification. Also, it has almost the same computational costs for training as conventional deep classifiers and outputs reliable predictions by a single inference. Extensive experimental results on classification benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method helps networks to produce well-ranked confidence estimates. We also demonstrate that it is effective for the tasks closely related to confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection and active learning.}

We study this problem from a theoretical viewpoint, measuring cluster quality by the k-means and k-medians objectives. In terms of negative results, we show that popular top-down decision tree algorithms may lead to clusterings with arbitrarily large cost, and any clustering based on a tree with k leaves must incur an Omega(log k) approximation factor compared to the optimal clustering. On the positive side, for two means/medians, we show that a single threshold cut can achieve a constant factor approximation, and we give nearly-matching lower bounds; for general k > 2, we design an efficient algorithm that leads to an O(k) approximation to the optimal k-medians and an O(k^2) approximation to the optimal k-means.

However, the precise effect that this has on the trained network is not yet fully understood. In this paper, we characterize the flat minima in linear neural networks trained with a quadratic loss. First, we show that linear ResNets with zero initialization necessarily converge to the flattest of all minima. We then prove that these minima correspond to nearly balanced networks whereby the gain from the input to any intermediate representation does not change drastically from one layer to the next. Finally, we show that consecutive layers in flat minima solutions are coupled. That is, one of the left singular vectors of each weight matrix, equals one of the right singular vectors of the next matrix. This forms a distinct path from input to output, that, as we show, is dedicated to the signal that experiences the largest gain end-to-end. Experiments indicate that these properties are characteristic of both linear and nonlinear models trained in practice.}

  abstract =   {Graph representation learning is a ubiquitous task in machine learning where the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution: the bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks that take high-dimensional features as inputs, while nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. In this setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices, and the main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.}

We then simultaneously address issues that may arise due to the presence of both missing data and unmeasured confounding, by extending these graphical conditions and proofs of completeness, to settings where some variables are not just missing, but completely unobserved.}

A different model is trained for every number of possible speakers, and the model with the largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample.

The most widely used metric for measuring the similarity between real and generated images has been the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Since it does not differentiate the fidelity and diversity aspects of the generated images, recent papers have introduced variants of precision and recall metrics to diagnose those properties separately. In this paper, we show that even the latest version of the precision and recall metrics are not reliable yet. For example, they fail to detect the match between two identical distributions, they are not robust against outliers, and the evaluation hyperparameters are selected arbitrarily. We propose density and coverage metrics that solve the above issues. We analytically and experimentally show that density and coverage provide more interpretable and reliable signals for practitioners than the existing metrics.}

However, multi-agent learning can be extremely difficult to predict and control. Learning dynamics even in simple games can yield chaotic behavior. In this paper, we present basic \emph{mechanism design} tools for constructing games with predictable and controllable dynamics. We show that arbitrarily large and complex network games, encoding both cooperation (team play) and competition (zero-sum interaction), exhibit conservation laws when agents use the standard regret-minimizing dynamics known as Follow-the-Regularized-Leader. These laws persist when different agents use different dynamics and encode long-range correlations between agents' behavior, even though the agents may not interact directly. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions under which the dynamics have multiple, linearly independent, conservation laws. Increasing the number of conservation laws results in more predictable dynamics, eventually making chaotic behavior formally impossible in some cases.}

In this paper, we propose AdaRound, a better weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization that adapts to the data and the task loss. AdaRound is fast, does not require fine-tuning of the network, and only uses a small amount of unlabelled data. We start by theoretically analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural network. By approximating the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the rounding task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local loss and propose to optimize this loss with a soft relaxation. AdaRound not only outperforms rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks. Without fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4 bits while staying within an accuracy loss of 1\%.}

However, one of the fundamental challenges in using a learned forward dynamics model is the mismatch between the objective of the learned model (future state reconstruction), and that of the downstream planner or policy (completing a specified task). This issue is exacerbated by vision-based control tasks in diverse real-world environments, where the complexity of the real world dwarfs model capacity. In this paper, we propose to direct prediction towards task relevant information, enabling the model to be aware of the current task and encouraging it to only model relevant quantities of the state space, resulting in a learning objective that more closely matches the downstream task. Further, we do so in an entirely self-supervised manner, without the need for a reward function or image labels. We find that our method more effectively models the relevant parts of the scene conditioned on the goal, and as a result outperforms standard task-agnostic dynamics models and model-free reinforcement learning.}

We present PolyGen, a generative model of 3D objects which models the mesh directly, predicting vertices and faces sequentially using a Transformer-based architecture. Our model can condition on a range of inputs, including object classes, voxels, and images, and because the model is probabilistic it can produce samples that capture uncertainty in ambiguous scenarios. We show that the model is capable of producing high-quality, usable meshes, and establish log-likelihood benchmarks for the mesh-modelling task. We also evaluate the conditional models on surface reconstruction metrics against alternative methods, and demonstrate competitive performance despite not training directly on this task.}

This technique augments a given optimization problem (e.g. deriving from an ERM problem) with a random linear term, and then exactly solves it. However, to date, analyses of this approach crucially rely on the convexity and smoothness of the objective function. We give two algorithms that extend this approach substantially. The first algorithm requires nothing except boundedness of the loss function, and operates over a discrete domain. Its privacy and accuracy guarantees hold even without assuming convexity. We are able to extend traditional analyses of objective perturbation by introducing a novel ``normalization`` step into the algorithm, which provides enough stability to be differentially private even without second-order conditions. The second algorithm operates over a continuous domain and requires only that the loss function be bounded and Lipschitz in its continuous parameter. Its privacy analysis does not even require convexity. Its accuracy analysis does require convexity, but does not require second order conditions like smoothness. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of the non-convex case, in which we use an integer program solver as our optimization oracle. We find that for the problem of learning linear classifiers, directly optimizing for 0/1 loss using our approach can out-perform the more standard approach of privately optimizing a convex-surrogate loss function on the Adult dataset.}

We also show that replacing the learned predictor by its conditional distribution with respect to an arbitrary $\sigma$-field is a convenient way to derandomize. We study two examples, inspired by the work of Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) and Bartlett et al. (2020), where the learned predictor interpolates the training data with high probability, has small risk, and, yet, does not belong to a nonrandom class with a tight uniform bound on two-sided generalization error. At the same time, we bound the risk of the learned predictor in terms of surrogates constructed by conditioning and denoising, respectively, and shown to belong to nonrandom classes with uniformly small generalization error.}

Building upon this, we describe a wide range of MCMC algorithms in terms of iMCMC, and formulate a number of ``tricks'' which one can use as design principles for developing new MCMC algorithms. Thus, iMCMC provides a unified view of many known MCMC algorithms, which facilitates the derivation of powerful extensions. We demonstrate the latter with two examples where we transform known reversible MCMC algorithms into more efficient irreversible ones.}

Viewing the expressive power of a graph classifier by the $\mathcal{F}$-indistinguishable concept, we prove the universality property of graph homomorphism vectors in approximating $\mathcal{F}$-invariant functions.

In this paper, we consider a new setting in BO in which the knowledge of the optimum output is available. Our goal is to exploit the knowledge about f$\ast$ to search for the input x$\ast$ efficiently. To achieve this goal, we first transform the Gaussian process surrogate using the information about the optimum output. Then, we propose two acquisition functions, called confidence bound minimization and expected regret minimization, which exploit the knowledge about the optimum output to identify the optimum input more efficient. We show that our approaches work intuitively and quantitatively better performance against standard BO methods. We demonstrate real applications in tuning a deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the CartPole problem and XGBoost on Skin Segmentation dataset in which the optimum values are publicly available.}

When embedded as structured hidden layers in a neural net, argmin differentiation and efficient gradient computation are further required. Recently, SparseMAP has been proposed as a differentiable, sparse alternative to maximum a posteriori (MAP) and marginal inference. SparseMAP returns an interpretable combination of a small number of structures; its sparsity being the key to efficient optimization. However, SparseMAP requires access to an exact MAP oracle in the structured model, excluding, e.g., loopy graphical models or logic constraints, which generally require approximate inference. In this paper, we introduce LP-SparseMAP, an extension of SparseMAP addressing this limitation via a local polytope relaxation. LP-SparseMAP uses the flexible and powerful language of factor graphs to define expressive hidden structures, supporting coarse decompositions, hard logic constraints, and higher-order correlations. We derive the forward and backward algorithms needed for using LP-SparseMAP as a structured hidden or output layer. Experiments in three structured tasks show benefits versus SparseMAP and Structured SVM.}

  abstract =   {Supervised learning requires the specification of a loss function to minimise. While the theory of admissible losses from both a computational and statistical perspective is well-developed, these offer a panoply of different choices. In practice, this choice is typically made in an \emph{ad hoc} manner. In hopes of making this procedure more principled, the problem of \emph{learning the loss function} for a downstream task (e.g., classification) has garnered recent interest. However, works in this area have been generally empirical in nature. In this paper, we revisit the {\sc SLIsotron} algorithm of Kakade et al. (2011) through a novel lens, derive a generalisation based on Bregman divergences, and show how it provides a principled procedure for learning the loss. In detail, we cast {\sc SLIsotron} as learning a loss from a family of composite square losses. By interpreting this through the lens of \emph{proper losses}, we derive a generalisation of {\sc SLIsotron} based on Bregman divergences. The resulting {\sc BregmanTron} algorithm jointly learns the loss along with the classifier. It comes equipped with a simple guarantee of convergence for the loss it learns, and its set of possible outputs comes with a guarantee of agnostic approximability of Bayes rule. Experiments indicate that the {\sc BregmanTron} significantly outperforms the {\sc SLIsotron}, and that the loss it learns can be minimized by other algorithms for different tasks, thereby opening the interesting problem of \emph{loss transfer} between domains.}

  abstract =   {Max-margin methods for binary classification such as the support vector machine (SVM) have been extended to the structured prediction setting under the name of max-margin Markov networks ($M^3N$), or more generally structural SVMs. Unfortunately, these methods are statistically inconsistent when the relationship between inputs and labels is far from deterministic. We overcome such limitations by defining the learning problem in terms of a ``max-min'' margin formulation, naming the resulting method max-min margin Markov networks ($M^4N$). We prove consistency and finite sample generalization bounds for $M^4N$ and provide an explicit algorithm to compute the estimator. The algorithm achieves a generalization error of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for a total cost of $O(n)$ projection-oracle calls (which have at most the same cost as the max-oracle from $M^3N$). Experiments on multi-class classification, ordinal regression, sequence prediction and ranking demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the concept applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis. We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression and demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the edge devices.

Optimizing the conventional Mean Square Error (MSE) loss results in a decoder matrix that spans the principal subspace of the sample covariance of the data, but, owing to an invariance that cancels out in the global map, it will fail to identify the exact eigenvectors. We show here that our proposed loss function eliminates this issue, so the decoder converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. We characterize the full structure of the new loss landscape by establishing an analytical expression for the set of all critical points, showing that it is a subset of critical points of MSE, and that all local minima are still global. Specifically, the invariant global minima under MSE are shown to become saddle points under the new loss. Additionally, the computational complexity of the loss and its gradients are the same as MSE and, thus, the new loss is not only of theoretical importance but is of practical value, e.g., for low-rank approximation.}

We study the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which is among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks. Our complexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efficient algorithms for this task, unless input matrices are forced to have favorable structures. In particular, we prove the following: (1) Computing $\sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})^p$ exactly for every (fixed) positive even integer $p$ is $\textsf{UP}$-hard and $\textsf{Mod}_3\textsf{P}$-hard, which gives a negative answer to an open question posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012). (2) $\sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S}) \det(\mathbf{B}_{S,S}) \det(\mathbf{C}_{S,S})$ is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $ 2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{I}|^{1-\epsilon})} $ for any $\epsilon > 0$, where $|\mathcal{I}|$ is the input size. This result is stronger than $\sharp\textsf{P}$-hardness for the case of two matrices by Gillenwater (2014).

  abstract =   {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet) that uses neural nets to produce \emph{good} representations to be used as inputs to an off-policy RL algorithm. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually thought to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger feature propagation together with larger networks allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves much higher sample efficiency and better performance.

Combined with smoothed WDs, the dual formulation allows us to devise efficient algorithms that take stochastic gradient descent steps through WD regularizers. We incorporate these regularizers into two novel on-policy algorithms, Behavior-Guided Policy Gradient and Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies, which we demonstrate can outperform existing methods in a variety of challenging environments.

In this work we introduce deep network architectures trained with labeled samples from any generative model of clustered datasets. At test time, the networks generate approximate posterior samples of cluster labels for any new dataset of arbitrary size. We develop two complementary approaches to this task, requiring either O(N) or O(K) network forward passes per dataset, where N is the dataset size and K the number of clusters. Unlike previous approaches, our methods sample the labels of all the data points from a well-defined posterior, and can learn nonparametric Bayesian posteriors since they do not limit the number of mixture components. As a scientific application, we present a novel approach to neural spike sorting for high-density multielectrode arrays.}

Recent works of Yin et al. and Krishnamurthy et al., 2019, focus on an experimental design setting of model recovery for this problem. It is assumed that the features can be designed and queried with to obtain their label. When queried, an oracle randomly selects one of the two different sparse linear models and generates a label accordingly. How many such oracle queries are needed to recover both of the models simultaneously? This question can also be thought of as a generalization of the well-known compressed sensing problem (Cand\`es and Tao, 2005, Donoho, 2006). In this work we address this query complexity problem and provide efficient algorithms that improves on the previously best known results.}

However, previous works paid little attention to modeling the backward network of MI (i.e., dependency from the target to the source), which is crucial to the tightness of the variational information maximization lower bound. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mutual Information (AMI): a text generation framework which is formed as a novel saddle point (min-max) optimization aiming to identify joint interactions between the source and target. Within this framework, the forward and backward networks are able to iteratively promote or demote each other's generated instances by comparing the real and synthetic data distributions. We also develop a latent noise sampling strategy that leverages random variations at the high-level semantic space to enhance the long term dependency in the generation process. Extensive experiments based on different text generation tasks demonstrate that the proposed AMI framework can significantly outperform several strong baselines, and we also show that AMI has potential to lead to a tighter lower bound of maximum mutual information for the variational information maximization problem.}

Harnessing the transformer's ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical.}

We develop a novel Multiresolution Tensor Learning (MRTL) algorithm for efficiently learning interpretable spatial patterns. MRTL initializes the latent factors from an approximate full-rank tensor model for improved interpretability and progressively learns from a coarse resolution to the fine resolution to reduce computation.

Transferred variations generate virtual samples that augment the feature space of the target class during training, simulating upcoming query samples with similar variations. By sharing the factors of variations across different classes, the model becomes more robust to variations in the unseen examples and tasks using small number of examples per class. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for few-shot classification and face recognition, on which our model significantly improves the performance of the base model, outperforming relevant baselines.}

With its fundamental theory and tractable optimal policy, LQR has been revisited and analyzed in recent years, in terms of reinforcement learning scenarios such as the model-free or model-based setting. In this paper, we introduce the Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) for LQR, a method capable of deriving a structured linear policy. Such a structured policy with (block) sparsity or low-rank can have significant advantages over the standard LQR policy: more interpretable, memory-efficient, and well-suited for the distributed setting. In order to derive such a policy, we first cast a regularized LQR problem when the model is known. Then, our Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) algorithm, which takes a policy evaluation step and a policy improvement step in an iterative manner, can solve this regularized LQR efficiently. We further extend the S-PI algorithm to the model-free setting where a smoothing procedure is adopted to estimate the gradient. In both the known-model and model-free setting, we prove convergence analysis under the proper choice of parameters. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the advantages of S-PI in terms of balancing the LQR performance and level of structure by varying the weight parameter.}

This incidentally gives access to a robust dissimilarity measure on the ground space, which can in turn be used in other applications. We propose algorithms to compute this robust cost, and illustrate the interest of this approach empirically.}

This paper studies the use of TD(0), a canonical TD algorithm, to estimate the value function of a given policy from a batch of data. In this batch setting, we show that TD(0) may converge to an inaccurate value function because the update following an action is weighted according to the number of times that action occurred in the batch -- not the true probability of the action under the given policy. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{policy sampling error corrected}-TD(0) (PSEC-TD(0)). PSEC-TD(0) first estimates the empirical distribution of actions in each state in the batch and then uses importance sampling to correct for the mismatch between the empirical weighting and the correct weighting for updates following each action. We refine the concept of a certainty-equivalence estimate and argue that PSEC-TD(0) is a more data efficient estimator than TD(0) for a fixed batch of data. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of PSEC-TD(0) on three batch value function learning tasks, with a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, and show that PSEC-TD(0) produces value function estimates with lower mean squared error than TD(0).}

These methods have a simple momentum-like update, in which each update only makes use on the current gradient and previous two iterates. Furthermore, the momentum and step-size parameters can be estimated without knowledge of the Hessian's smallest singular value, in contrast with classical accelerated methods like Nesterov acceleration and Polyak momentum. Through empirical benchmarks on quadratic and logistic regression problems, we identify regimes in which the the proposed methods improve over classical (worst-case) accelerated methods.}

At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation.

  abstract =   {Studying the set of exact solutions of a system of polynomial equations largely depends on a single iterative algorithm, known as Buchberger's algorithm. Optimized versions of this algorithm are crucial for many computer algebra systems (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, Sage). We introduce a new approach to Buchberger's algorithm that uses reinforcement learning agents to perform S-pair selection, a key step in the algorithm. We then study how the difficulty of the problem depends on the choices of domain and distribution of polynomials, about which little is known. Finally, we train a policy model using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to learn S-pair selection strategies for random systems of binomial equations. In certain domains, the trained model outperforms state-of-the-art selection heuristics in total number of polynomial additions performed, which provides a proof-of-concept that recent developments in machine learning have the potential to improve performance of algorithms in symbolic computation.}

Furthermore, we build the parallel text-to-speech system by applying various parallel neural vocoders, which can synthesize speech from text through a single feed-forward pass.

  abstract =   {When predictions support decisions they may influence the outcome they aim to predict. We call such predictions performative; the prediction influences the target. Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining. We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal loss. In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.}

Since direct differentiation and backpropagation is not possible, Monte Carlo gradient estimation techniques are a popular alternative. Efficient stochastic gradient estimators, such Straight-Through and Gumbel-Softmax, work well for shallow stochastic models. Their performance, however, suffers with hierarchical, more complex models. We focus on stochastic networks with Boolean latent variables. To analyze such networks, we introduce the framework of harmonic analysis for Boolean functions to derive an analytic formulation for the bias and variance in the Straight-Through estimator. Exploiting these formulations, we propose \emph{FouST}, a low-bias and low-variance gradient estimation algorithm that is just as efficient. Extensive experiments show that FouST performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art biased estimators and is much faster than unbiased ones.}

We analyse the classical statistical test proposed by Pflug (1983), based on the inner product between consecutive stochastic gradients.

To the best of our knowledge, this complexity is better than the best known complexity upper bound of the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which is of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$. Our proof technique is based on the geometric convergence rate of the Sinkhorn updates to the optimal dual solution of the entropic regularized UOT problem and scaling properties of the primal solution. It is also different from the proof technique used to establish the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for approximating the OT problem since the UOT solution does not need to meet the marginal constraints of the measures.}

To address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness, we design an original adversarial objective function, based on the post-processing property in DP, to tighten the sensitivity of our model. A new stochastic batch training is proposed to apply our mechanism on large DNNs and datasets, by bypassing the vanilla iterative batch-by-batch training in DP DNNs. An end-to-end theoretical analysis and evaluations show that our mechanism notably improves the robustness and scalability of DP DNNs.}

WaveFlow provides a unified view of likelihood-based models for 1-D data, including WaveNet and WaveGlow as special cases. It generates high-fidelity speech as WaveNet, while synthesizing several orders of magnitude faster as it only requires a few sequential steps to generate very long waveforms with hundreds of thousands of time-steps. Furthermore, it can significantly reduce the likelihood gap that has existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models for efficient synthesis. Finally, our small-footprint WaveFlow has only 5.91M parameters, which is 15{\texttimes} smaller than WaveGlow. It can generate 22.05 kHz high-fidelity audio 42.6{\texttimes} faster than real-time (at a rate of 939.3 kHz) on a V100 GPU without engineered inference kernels.}

We present the adversarial attacks and defenses problem as an \emph{infinite} zero-sum game where classical results (\emph{e.g.} Nash or Sion theorems) do not apply. We demonstrate the non-existence of a Nash equilibrium in our game when the classifier and the Adversary are both deterministic, hence giving a negative answer to the above question in the deterministic regime. Nonetheless, the question remains open in the randomized regime. We tackle this problem by showing that any deterministic classifier can be outperformed by a randomized one. This gives arguments for using randomization, and leads us to a simple method for building randomized classifiers that are robust to state-or-the-art adversarial attacks. Empirical results validate our theoretical analysis, and show that our defense method considerably outperforms Adversarial Training against strong adaptive attacks, by achieving 0.55 accuracy under adaptive PGD-attack on CIFAR10, compared to 0.42 for Adversarial training.}

The domain specific components are discarded after training and only the common component is retained. The algorithm is extremely simple and involves only modifying the final linear classification layer of any given neural network architecture. We present a principled analysis to understand existing approaches, provide identifiability results of CSD, and study the effect of low-rank on domain generalization. We show that CSD either matches or beats state of the art approaches for domain generalization based on domain erasure, domain perturbed data augmentation, and meta-learning. Further diagnostics on rotated MNIST, where domains are interpretable, confirm the hypothesis that CSD successfully disentangles common and domain specific components and hence leads to better domain generalization; moreover, our code and dataset are publicly available at the following URL: \url{https://github.com/vihari/csd}.}

We propose to optimize this objective by having the agent pursue past achieved goals in sparsely explored areas of the goal space, which focuses exploration on the frontier of the achievable goal set.

In this work, we define sharpness for submodular functions as a candidate explanation for this phenomenon.

This improvement ties in closely with the faster convergence rates of first order methods for sharp functions in convex optimization.}

Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing goal reaching performance together with the entropy of the goal distribution, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. We prove that, under regularity conditions, Skew-Fit converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that combining Skew-Fit for learning goal distributions with existing goal-reaching methods outperforms a variety of prior methods on open-sourced visual goal-reaching tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Skew-Fit enables a real-world robot to learn to open a door, entirely from scratch, from pixels, and without any manually-designed reward function.}

In this work we propose a simple continuous relaxation for the argsort operator which has the following qualities: it can be implemented in three lines of code, achieves state-of-the-art performance, is easy to reason about mathematically - substantially simplifying proofs - and is faster than competing approaches. We open source the code to reproduce all of the experiments and results.}

We fill this gap and rigorously analyze the performance of graph-based NNS algorithms, specifically focusing on the low-dimensional ($d \ll \log n$) regime. In addition to the basic greedy algorithm on nearest neighbor graphs, we also analyze the most successful heuristics commonly used in practice: speeding up via adding shortcut edges and improving accuracy via maintaining a dynamic list of candidates. We believe that our theoretical insights supported by experimental analysis are an important step towards understanding the limits and benefits of graph-based NNS algorithms.}

Optimal adversarial risk quantifies the best error rate of any classifier in the presence of adversaries, and optimal adversarial classifiers are sought that minimize adversarial risk. In this paper, we investigate the optimal adversarial risk and optimal adversarial classifiers from an optimal transport perspective. We present a new and simple approach to show that the optimal adversarial risk for binary classification with 0 − 1 loss function is completely characterized by an optimal transport cost between the probability distributions of the two classes, for a suitably defined cost function. We propose a novel coupling strategy that achieves the optimal transport cost for several univariate distributions like Gaussian, uniform and triangular. Using the optimal couplings, we obtain the optimal adversarial classifiers in these settings and show how they differ from optimal classifiers in the absence of adversaries. Based on our analysis, we evaluate algorithm-independent fundamental limits on adversarial risk for CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets, and Gaussian mixtures based on them.}

Obtaining disentangled representations of these components is useful in many speech analysis and generation applications. Recently, state-of-the-art voice conversion systems have led to speech representations that can disentangle speaker-dependent and independent information. However, these systems can only disentangle timbre, while information about pitch, rhythm and content is still mixed together. Further disentangling the remaining speech components is an under-determined problem in the absence of explicit annotations for each component, which are difficult and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose SpeechSplit, which can blindly decompose speech into its four components by introducing three carefully designed information bottlenecks. SpeechSplit is among the first algorithms that can separately perform style transfer on timbre, pitch and rhythm without text labels.

We develop a scalable framework for differentiable physics that can support a large number of objects and their interactions. To accommodate objects with arbitrary geometry and topology, we adopt meshes as our representation and leverage the sparsity of contacts for scalable differentiable collision handling. Collisions are resolved in localized regions to minimize the number of optimization variables even when the number of simulated objects is high. We further accelerate implicit differentiation of optimization with nonlinear constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the presented framework requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory and computation in comparison to recent particle-based methods. We further validate the approach on inverse problems and control scenarios, where it outperforms derivative-free and model-free baselines by at least an order of magnitude.}

Specifically, we consider a new framework for this problem where the sparsity is implicitly enforced via mapping a low dimensional representation $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^k$ through a known $n$-layer ReLU generative network $G:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\theta_0 = G(x_0)$. Such a framework poses low-dimensional priors on $\theta_0$ without a known sparsity basis. We propose to recover the target $G(x_0)$ solving an unconstrained empirical risk minimization (ERM). Under a weak \emph{sub-exponential measurement assumption}, we establish a joint statistical and computational analysis. In particular, we prove that the ERM estimator in this new framework achieves a statistical rate of $m=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(kn \log d /\varepsilon^2)$ recovering any $G(x_0)$ uniformly up to an error $\varepsilon$. When the network is shallow (i.e., $n$ is small), we show this rate matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithm factors of $\varepsilon^{-1}$. From the lens of computation, we prove that under proper conditions on the network weights, our proposed empirical risk, despite non-convexity, has no stationary point outside of small neighborhoods around the true representation $x_0$ and its negative multiple; furthermore, we show that the global minimizer of the empirical risk stays within the neighborhood around $x_0$ rather than its negative multiple under further assumptions on weights.}

We propose a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach to effectively learn the posterior distribution of the prototype vectors of relations, where the initial prior of the prototype vectors is parameterized with a graph neural network on the global relation graph.

The whole framework can be effectively and efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion.

In the healthcare setting, interpretable models should implicate relevant biological mechanisms independent of technical factors like data pre-processing. We define personalized interpretability as a measure of sample-specific feature attribution, and view it as a minimum requirement for a precision health model to justify its conclusions. Some health data, especially those generated by high-throughput sequencing experiments, have nuances that compromise precision health models and their interpretation. These data are compositional, meaning that each feature is conditionally dependent on all other features. We propose the Deep Compositional Data Analysis (DeepCoDA) framework to extend precision health modelling to high-dimensional compositional data, and to provide personalized interpretability through patient-specific weights. Our architecture maintains state-of-the-art performance across 25 real-world data sets, all while producing interpretations that are both personalized and fully coherent for compositional data.}

Many machine learning problems, including data summarization and influence maximization, can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions. However, when such applications involve sensitive data about individuals, their privacy concerns should be addressed. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions subject to matroid constraints in the framework of differential privacy. We provide $(1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}})$-approximation algorithm which improves upon the previous results in terms of approximation guarantee. This is done with an almost cubic number of function evaluations in our algorithm. Moreover, we study $k$-submodularity, a natural generalization of submodularity. We give the first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that preserves differential privacy for maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions subject to matroid constraints. The approximation ratio is asymptotically tight and is obtained with an almost linear number of function evaluations.}

We formulate the training of a MALC model as a convex optimization problem, optimizing the predictive accuracy and transparency (defined as the percentage of data captured by the linear models) in the objective function. Experiments show that MALC offers more model flexibility for users to balance transparency and accuracy, in contrast to the currently available choice of either a pure black-box model or a pure interpretable model. The human evaluation also shows that more users are likely to choose MALC for this model flexibility compared with interpretable models and black-box models.}

Previous explanations for this tradeoff rely on the assumption that no predictor in the hypothesis class has low standard and robust error. In this work, we precisely characterize the effect of augmentation on the standard error in linear regression when the optimal linear predictor has zero standard and robust error. In particular, we show that the standard error could increase even when the augmented perturbations have noiseless observations from the optimal linear predictor. We then prove that the recently proposed robust self-training (RST) estimator improves robust error without sacrificing standard error for noiseless linear regression. Empirically, for neural networks, we find that RST with different adversarial training methods improves both standard and robust error for random and adversarial rotations and adversarial l_infty perturbations in CIFAR-10.}

PD-VF explicitly estimates the cumulative reward in a space of policies and environments. An ensemble of conventional RL policies is used to gather experience on training environments, from which embeddings of both policies and environments can be learned. Then, a value function conditioned on both embeddings is trained. At test time, a few actions are sufficient to infer the environment embedding, enabling a policy to be selected by maximizing the learned value function (which requires no additional environment interaction). We show that our method can rapidly adapt to new dynamics on a set of MuJoCo domains.}

Here we address the use of deep-learning networks as inverse problem solvers, which has generated much excitement and even adoption efforts by the main equipment vendors for medical imaging including computed tomography (CT) and MRI. However, the recent demonstration that such networks suffer from a similar vulnerability to adversarial attacks potentially undermines their future. We propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary net-work to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks. Theoretically, we argue that for such inverse problem solvers, one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the measurement-space, instead of in the signal-space used in previous work. We show for a linear reconstruction scheme that our min-max formulation results in a singular-value filter regularized solution, which suppresses the effect of adversarial examples. Numerical experiments using the proposed min-max scheme confirm convergence to this solution. We complement the theory by experiments on non-linear Compressive Sensing(CS) reconstruction by a deep neural network on two standard datasets, and, using anonymized clinical data, on a state-of-the-art published algorithm for low-dose x-ray CT reconstruction. We show a significant improvement in robustness over other methods for deep network-based reconstruction, by using the proposed approach.}

As networks grow in size and complexity, training time can be reduced through low-precision data representations and computations, however, in doing so the final accuracy suffers due to the problem of vanishing gradients. Existing state-of-the-art methods combat this issue by means of a mixed-precision approach utilising two different precision levels, FP32 (32-bit floating-point) and FP16/FP8 (16-/8-bit floating-point), leveraging the hardware support of recent GPU architectures for FP16 operations to obtain performance gains. This work pushes the boundary of quantised training by employing a multilevel optimisation approach that utilises multiple precisions including low-precision fixed-point representations resulting in a novel training strategy MuPPET; it combines the use of multiple number representation regimes together with a precision-switching mechanism that decides at run time the transition point between precision regimes. Overall, the proposed strategy tailors the training process to the hardware-level capabilities of the target hardware architecture and yields improvements in training time and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Applying MuPPET on the training of AlexNet, ResNet18 and GoogLeNet on ImageNet (ILSVRC12) and targeting an NVIDIA Turing GPU, MuPPET achieves the same accuracy as standard full-precision training with training-time speedup of up to 1.84x and an average speedup of 1.58x across the networks.}

We show that a near-optimal policy for the environment can be obtained by finding an approximate equilibrium for aforementioned game, and we develop two families of algorithms to find the game equilibrium by drawing upon ideas from Stackelberg games.

A recent line of breakthrough works on SGD without replacement (SGDo) established an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{T^2}\right)$ convergence rate when the function minimized is strongly convex and is a sum of $n$ smooth functions, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}+\frac{n^3}{T^3}\right)$ rate for sums of quadratics.

In this paper, we close this gap and show that SGD without replacement achieves a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}+\frac{n^2}{T^3}\right)$ when the sum of the functions is a quadratic, and offer a new lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{T^2}\right)$ for strongly convex functions that are sums of smooth functions.}

The attacker can manipulate the rewards or the transition dynamics in the learning environment at training-time and is interested in doing so in a stealthy manner. We propose an optimization framework for finding an \emph{optimal stealthy attack} for different measures of attack cost. We provide sufficient technical conditions under which the attack is feasible and provide lower/upper bounds on the attack cost. We instantiate our attacks in two settings: (i) an \emph{offline} setting where the agent is doing planning in the poisoned environment, and (ii) an \emph{online} setting where the agent is learning a policy using a regret-minimization framework with poisoned feedback.

We design a training algorithm for our generative model based on the amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this exploration algorithm in both pure exploration tasks and a downstream task, comparing with state-of-the-art intrinsic reward-based exploration approaches, including two recent approaches based on an ensemble of dynamic models.

  abstract =   {Group invariant and equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), also known as Equivariant Networks and Group Group Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNN) have achieved remarkable success in learning on a variety of data structures, such as sequences, images, sets, and graphs. This paper proves the universality of a broad class of equivariant MLPs with a single hidden layer. In particular, it is shown that having a hidden layer on which the group acts regularly is sufficient for universal equivariance (invariance). For example, some types of steerable-CNN's become universal. Another corollary is the unconditional universality of equivariant MLPs for all Abelian groups. A third corollary is the universality of equivariant MLPs with a high-order hidden layer, where we give both group-agnostic bounds and group-specific bounds on the order of the hidden layer that guarantees universal equivariance.}

  abstract =   {Machine learning research has advanced in multiple aspects, including model structures and learning methods. The effort to automate such research, known as AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on sophisticated expert-designed layers as building blocks---or similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available. We believe these preliminary successes in discovering machine learning algorithms from scratch indicate a promising new direction for the field.}

The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user is expensive. We propose an algorithm that safely and efficiently learns a model of the user's reward function by posing 'what if?' questions about hypothetical agent behavior. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different initial state distributions. Moreover, ReQueST safely trains the reward model to detect unsafe states, and corrects reward hacking before deploying the agent.}

We begin our analysis by introducing the self-bounding Lipschitz condition for multi-output loss functions, which interpolates continuously between a classical Lipschitz condition and a multi-dimensional analogue of a smoothness condition. We then show that the self-bounding Lipschitz condition gives rise to optimistic bounds for multi-output learning, which attain the minimax optimal rate up to logarithmic factors. The proof exploits local Rademacher complexity combined with a powerful minoration inequality due to Srebro, Sridharan and Tewari. As an application we derive a state-of-the-art generalisation bound for multi-class gradient boosting.}

Active learning can improve the achieved classification performance for a given budget on the number of queried labels. The best existing methods are based on graph neural networks, but they often perform poorly unless a sizeable validation set of labelled nodes is available in order to choose good hyperparameters. We propose a novel graph-based active learning algorithm for the task of node classification in attributed graphs; our algorithm uses graph cognizant logistic regression, equivalent to a linearized graph-convolutional neural network (GCN), for the prediction phase and maximizes the expected error reduction in the query phase. To reduce the delay experienced by a labeller interacting with the system, we derive a preemptive querying system that calculates a new query during the labelling process, and to address the setting where learning starts with almost no labelled data, we also develop a hybrid algorithm that performs adaptive model averaging of label propagation and linearized GCN inference. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches and illustrate the practical value of the method by applying it to a private microwave link network dataset.}

From a given set of items, the learner can make pairwise comparisons on every pair of items, and each comparison returns an independent noisy result about the preferred item. At any time, the learner can adaptively choose a pair of items to compare according to past observations (i.e., active learning). The learner's goal is to find the (approximately) best-$k$ items with a given confidence, while trying to use as few comparisons as possible. In this paper, we study two problems: (i) finding the probably approximately correct (PAC) best-$k$ items and (ii) finding the exact best-$k$ items, both under strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. For PAC best-$k$ items selection, we first show a lower bound and then propose an algorithm whose sample complexity upper bound matches the lower bound up to a constant factor. For the exact best-$k$ items selection, we first prove a worst-instance lower bound. We then propose two algorithms based on our PAC best items selection algorithms: one works for $k=1$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a loglog factor, and the other works for all values of $k$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a log factor.}

While most classical models focus on few, hand-selected graph statistics and are too simplistic to reproduce real-world graphs, NetGAN recently emerged as an attractive alternative: by training a GAN to learn the random walk distribution of the input graph, the algorithm is able to reproduce a large number of important network patterns simultaneously, without explicitly specifying any of them. In this paper, we investigate the implicit bias of NetGAN. We find that the root of its generalization properties does not lie in the GAN architecture, but in an inconspicuous low-rank approximation of the logits random walk transition matrix. Step by step we can strip NetGAN of all unnecessary parts, including the GAN, and obtain a highly simplified reformulation that achieves comparable generalization results, but is orders of magnitudes faster and easier to adapt. Being much simpler on the conceptual side, we reveal the implicit inductive bias of the algorithm --- an important step towards increasing the interpretability, transparency and acceptance of machine learning systems.}

In this paper, we empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and perturbation models (L-infinity and L-2). Based upon this observed effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic improvements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early stopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still occur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed overfitting. Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning remedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and find that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains achieved by early stopping. All code for reproducing the experiments as well as pretrained model weights and training logs can be found at https://github.com/ locuslab/robust_overfitting.}

Along with reducing the memory footprint, random features are particularly convenient in this setting as they provide a common parameterisation across agents that allows to overcome previous difficulties in implementing decentralised kernel regression. Under standard source and capacity assumptions, we establish high probability bounds on the predictive performance for each agent as a function of the step size, number of iterations, inverse spectral gap of the communication matrix and number of random features. By tuning these parameters, we obtain statistical rates that are minimax optimal with respect to the total number of samples in the network. The algorithm provides a linear improvement over single-machine gradient descent in memory cost and, when agents hold enough data with respect to the network size and inverse spectral gap, a linear speed up in computational run-time for any network topology. We present simulations that show how the number of random features, iterations and samples impact predictive performance.}

In this paper, we propose contextual decomposition explanation penalization (CDEP), a method which enables practitioners to leverage existing explanation methods to increase the predictive accuracy of a deep learning model. In particular, when shown that a model has incorrectly assigned importance to some features, CDEP enables practitioners to correct these errors by inserting domain knowledge into the model via explanations. We demonstrate the ability of CDEP to increase performance on an array of toy and real datasets.}

This acceleration can happen even if, by itself, the strongly labeled data admits only the slower O(1/\sqrt{n}) rate. The acceleration depends continuously on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks. Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task.}

Statistical theoretical developments for machine learning have been mostly concerned with approximability or rates of estimation when recovering infinite dimensional objects (curves or densities). Despite the impressive array of available theoretical results, the literature has been largely silent about uncertainty quantification. In this work, we continue the theoretical investigation of BART initiated recently by Rockova and van der Pas (2017). We focus on statistical inference questions. In particular, we study the Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) phenomenon (i.e. asymptotic normality) for smooth linear functionals of the regression surface within the framework of non-parametric regression with fixed covariates. Our semi-parametric BvM results show that, beyond rate-optimal estimation, BART can be also used for valid statistical inference.}

To address this problem, we propose FR-Train, which holistically performs fair and robust model training. We provide a mutual information-based interpretation of an existing adversarial training-based fairness-only method, and apply this idea to architect an additional discriminator that can identify poisoned data using a clean validation set and reduce its influence. In our experiments, FR-Train shows almost no decrease in fairness and accuracy in the presence of data poisoning by both mitigating the bias and defending against poisoning. We also demonstrate how to construct clean validation sets using crowdsourcing, and release new benchmark datasets.}

Our theoretical results characterize the optimal strategies in this class, bound the Pareto errors due to inaccuracies in the scores, and show an equivalence between optimal strategies and a rich class of fairness-constrained profit-maximizing policies. We then present empirical results in two different contexts --- online content recommendation and sustainable abalone fisheries --- to underscore the generality of our approach to a wide range of practical decisions.

As a byproduct, we show that the p-rescaled gradient flow (p-RGF) proposed by Wibisono et al.

Thus, we effectively bridge a gap between the p-RGF and the normalized gradient flow (NGF) (p=\infty) proposed by Cortes (2006) in his seminal paper in the context of multi-agent systems.

Unlike other well-studied models in reinforcement learning (RL), the length of an episode is not predetermined (or bounded) and is influenced by the agent's actions. Recently, \cite{tarbouriech2019noregret} studied this problem in the context of regret minimization, and provided an algorithm whose regret bound is inversely proportional to the square root of the minimum instantaneous cost. In this work we remove this dependence on the minimum cost---we give an algorithm that guarantees a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(B^{3/2} S \sqrt{A K})$, where $B$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions and $K$ is the total number of episodes. We additionally show that any learning algorithm must have at least $\Omega(B \sqrt{S A K})$ regret in the worst case.}

A renewed interest in learning choice models has led to improved modeling power, but most current methods are either limited in the type of choice behavior they capture, cannot be applied to large-scale data, or both. Here we propose a learning framework for predicting choice that is accurate, versatile, and theoretically grounded. Our key modeling point is that to account for how humans choose, predictive models must be expressive enough to accommodate complex choice patterns but structured enough to retain statistical efficiency. Building on recent results in economics, we derive a class of models that achieves this balance, and propose a neural implementation that allows for scalable end-to-end training. Experiments on three large choice datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.}

In this work, we present a unifying view of randomized smoothing over arbitrary functions, and we leverage this novel characterization to propose a new strategy for building classifiers that are pointwise-certifiably robust to general data poisoning attacks. As a specific instantiation, we utilize our framework to build linear classifiers that are robust to a strong variant of label flipping, where each test example is targeted independently. In other words, for each test point, our classifier includes a certification that its prediction would be the same had some number of training labels been changed adversarially. Randomized smoothing has previously been used to guarantee---with high probability---test-time robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to a classifier; we derive a variant which provides a deterministic, analytical bound, sidestepping the probabilistic certificates that traditionally result from the sampling subprocedure. Further, we obtain these certified bounds with minimal additional runtime complexity over standard classification and no assumptions on the train or test distributions. We generalize our results to the multi-class case, providing the first multi-class classification algorithm that is certifiably robust to label-flipping attacks.}

Although the field benefits from the rapid progress, the divergence in training protocols, architectures, and parameter choices make an unbiased comparison difficult. To provide a consistent reference point, we revisit the most widely used DML objective functions and conduct a study of the crucial parameter choices as well as the commonly neglected mini-batch sampling process. Under consistent comparison, DML objectives show much higher saturation than indicated by literature. Further based on our analysis, we uncover a correlation between the embedding space density and compression to the generalization performance of DML models. Exploiting these insights, we propose a simple, yet effective, training regularization to reliably boost the performance of ranking-based DML models on various standard benchmark datasets.

A key insight in the design of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch.This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and good convergence. We prove that FetchSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and a transformer model.}

Both frameworks are not scalable to practical applications involving multiple categorical variables, each with multiple possible values. We propose a new approach, Continuous and Categorical Bayesian Optimisation (CoCaBO), which combines the strengths of multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimisation to select values for both categorical and continuous inputs. We model this mixed-type space using a Gaussian Process kernel, designed to allow sharing of information across multiple categorical variables; this allows CoCaBO to leverage all available data efficiently. We extend our method to the batch setting and propose an efficient selection procedure that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation whilst encouraging batch diversity. We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world optimisation tasks with continuous and categorical inputs.}

In contrast with classical LSH algorithms that produce low dimensional hash codes, FlyHash produces sparse high-dimensional hash codes and has also been shown to have superior empirical performance compared to classical LSH algorithms in similarity search. However, FlyHash uses random projections and cannot learn from data. Building on inspiration from FlyHash and the ubiquity of sparse expansive representations in neurobiology, our work proposes a novel hashing algorithm BioHash that produces sparse high dimensional hash codes in a data-driven manner. We show that BioHash outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing methods. Since our learning algorithm is based on a local and biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule, our work provides evidence for the proposal that LSH might be a computational reason for the abundance of sparse expansive motifs in a variety of biological systems. We also propose a convolutional variant BioConvHash that further improves performance. From the perspective of computer science, BioHash and BioConvHash are fast, scalable and yield compressed binary representations that are useful for similarity search.}

We then attack this system using simple gradient methods and show that it is easily broken with white-box attacks. By scaling these perturbations up, we can create transfer attacks on industrial systems, such as the AudioTag copyright detector and YouTube's Content ID system, using perturbations that are audible but significantly smaller than a random baseline. Our goal is to raise awareness of the threats posed by adversarial examples in this space and to highlight the importance of hardening copyright detection systems to attacks.}

We show that these aggregate statistics can be used to lower-bound the discrepancy of a classifier, which is a measure that balances inaccuracy and unfairness. To this end, we define a new measure of unfairness, equal to the fraction of the population on which the classifier behaves differently, compared to its global, ideally fair behavior, as defined by the measure of equalized odds. We propose an efficient and practical procedure for finding the best possible lower bound on the discrepancy of the classifier, given the aggregate statistics, and demonstrate in experiments the empirical tightness of this lower bound, as well as its possible uses on various types of problems, ranging from estimating the quality of voting polls to measuring the effectiveness of patient identification from internet search queries.

Experiments on large-scale benchmarks (Imagenet), with standard architectures (Resnet-18, VGG-16, Densenet-121) and training procedures, show that we detect radioactive data with high confidence (p<0.0001) when only 1\% of the data used to train a model is radioactive. Our radioactive mark is resilient to strong data augmentations and variations of the model architecture. As a result, it offers a much higher signal-to-noise ratio than data poisoning and backdoor methods.}

Since the mixing variable is latent, we consider causal structure discovery algorithms such as FCI that can deal with latent variables. We show that such algorithms recover a ``union'' of the component DAGs and can identify variables whose conditional distribution across the component DAGs vary. We demonstrate our results on synthetic and real data showing that the inferred graph identifies nodes that vary between the different mixture components. As an immediate application, we demonstrate how retrieval of this causal information can be used to cluster samples according to each mixture component.}

Through simulations and experiments on two image datasets, we identify two key properties of the training data that drive this behavior: the proportions of majority versus minority groups, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the spurious correlations. We then analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how the inductive bias of models towards ``memorizing'' fewer examples can cause overparameterization to hurt. Our analysis leads to a counterintuitive approach of subsampling the majority group, which empirically achieves low minority error in the overparameterized regime, even though the standard approach of upweighting the minority fails. Overall, our results suggest a tension between using overparameterized models versus using all the training data for achieving low worst-group error.}

The best existing efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms for this problem only guarantee an $O(T^{2/3})$ upper-bound on the regret. Yet, inefficient algorithms based on EXP4 can achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we provide a new computationally efficient algorithm inspired by EXP3 satisfying a regret of order $O(\sqrt{T})$ when the availabilities of each action $i \in \cA$ are independent. We then study the most general version of the problem where at each round available sets are generated from some unknown arbitrary distribution (i.e., without the independence assumption) and propose an efficient algorithm with $O(\sqrt {2^K T})$ regret guarantee.

In contrast, the use of these functions for probabilistic modeling has received surprisingly little attention so far. In this work, we firstly propose the Generalized Multilinear Extension, a continuous DR-submodular extension for integer submodular functions. We study central properties of this extension and formulate a new probabilistic model which is defined through integer submodular functions. Then, we introduce a block-coordinate ascent algorithm to perform approximate inference for this class of models and finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness and viability on several real-world social connection graph datasets with integer submodular objectives.}

  abstract =   {Despite recent advancements in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-network (DQN) models still show lackluster performance on problems with high-dimensional action spaces. The problem is even more pronounced for cases with high-dimensional continuous action spaces due to a combinatorial increase in the number of the outputs. Recent works approach the problem by dividing the network into multiple parallel or sequential (action) modules responsible for different discretized actions. However, there are drawbacks to both the parallel and the sequential approaches. Parallel module architectures lack coordination between action modules, leading to extra complexity in the task, while a sequential structure can result in the vanishing gradients problem and exploding parameter space. In this work, we show that the compositional structure of the action modules has a significant impact on model performance. We propose a novel approach to infer the network structure for DQN models operating with high-dimensional continuous actions.

  abstract =   {Logistic models are commonly used for binary classification tasks. The success of such models has often been attributed to their connection to maximum-likelihood estimators. It has been shown that gradient descent algorithm, when applied on the logistic loss, converges to the max-margin classifier (a.k.a. hard-margin SVM). The performance of the max-margin classifier has been recently analyzed in~\cite{montanari2019generalization, deng2019model}. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we present and study a more general setting, where the underlying parameters of the logistic model possess certain structures (sparse, block-sparse, low-rank, etc.) and introduce a more general framework (which is referred to as ``Generalized Margin Maximizer'', GMM). While classical max-margin classifiers minimize the $2$-norm of the parameter vector subject to linearly separating the data, GMM minimizes any arbitrary convex function of the parameter vector. We provide a precise analysis of the performance of GMM via the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. We also provide a detailed study for three special cases: ($1$) $\ell_2$-GMM that is the max-margin classifier, ($2$) $\ell_1$-GMM which encourages sparsity, and ($3$) $\ell_{\infty}$-GMM which is often used when the parameter vector has binary entries. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive simulation results across a range of parameter values, problem instances, and model structures.}

  abstract =   {A framework based on iterative coordinate minimization (CM) is developed for stochastic convex optimization. Given that exact coordinate minimization is impossible due to the unknown stochastic nature of the objective function, the crux of the proposed optimization algorithm is an optimal control of the minimization precision in each iteration. We establish the optimal precision control and the resulting order-optimal regret performance for strongly convex and separably nonsmooth functions. An interesting finding is that the optimal progression of precision across iterations is independent of the low-dimension CM routine employed, suggesting a general framework for extending low-dimensional optimization routines to high-dimensional problems. The proposed algorithm is amenable to online implementation and inherits the scalability and parallelizability properties of CM for large-scale optimization. Requiring only a sublinear order of message exchanges, it also lends itself well to distributed computing as compared with the alternative approach of coordinate gradient descent.}

  abstract =   {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular methodology to tune the hyperparameters of expensive black-box functions. Traditionally, BO focuses on a single task at a time and is not designed to leverage information from related functions, such as tuning performance objectives of the same algorithm across multiple datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to achieve transfer learning across different datasets as well as different objectives. The main idea is to regress the mapping from hyperparameter to objective quantiles with a semi-parametric Gaussian Copula distribution, which provides robustness against different scales or outliers that can occur in different tasks. We introduce two methods to leverage this estimation: a Thompson sampling strategy as well as a Gaussian Copula process using such quantile estimate as a prior. We show that these strategies can combine the estimation of multiple objectives such as latency and accuracy, steering the optimization toward faster predictions for the same level of accuracy. Experiments on an extensive set of hyperparameter tuning tasks demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.}

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.}

When gradient confusion is high, stochastic gradients produced by different data samples may be negatively correlated, slowing down convergence. But when gradient confusion is low, data samples interact harmoniously, and training proceeds quickly. Through theoretical and experimental results, we demonstrate how the neural network architecture affects gradient confusion, and thus the efficiency of training. Our results show that, for popular initialization techniques, increasing the width of neural networks leads to lower gradient confusion, and thus faster model training. On the other hand, increasing the depth of neural networks has the opposite effect. Our results indicate that alternate initialization techniques or networks using both batch normalization and skip connections help reduce the training burden of very deep networks.}

As such, they are of interest in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains. Yet classical BBO methods fall short in high-dimensional non-convex problems. They are thus often overlooked in real-world AI tasks. Here we present a BBO method, termed Explicit Gradient Learning (EGL), that is designed to optimize high-dimensional ill-behaved functions. We derive EGL by finding weak spots in methods that fit the objective function with a parametric Neural Network (NN) model and obtain the gradient signal by calculating the parametric gradient. Instead of fitting the function, EGL trains a NN to estimate the objective gradient directly. We prove the convergence of EGL to a stationary point and its robustness in the optimization of integrable functions. We evaluate EGL and achieve state-of-the-art results in two challenging problems: (1) the COCO test suite against an assortment of standard BBO methods; and (2) in a high-dimensional non-convex image generation task.}

In this paper, we propose to detect OOD examples by identifying inconsistencies between activity patterns and predicted class. We find that characterizing activity patterns by Gram matrices and identifying anomalies in Gram matrix values can yield high OOD detection rates. We identify anomalies in the Gram matrices by simply comparing each value with its respective range observed over the training data. Unlike many approaches, this can be used with any pre-trained softmax classifier and neither requires access to OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters, nor does it require OOD access for inferring parameters. We empirically demonstrate applicability across a variety of architectures and vision datasets and, for the important and surprisingly hard task of detecting far out-of-distribution examples, it generally performs better than or equal to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods (including those that do assume access to OOD examples).}

In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any behavior as long as it maximizes rewards, but in the real world, undesired behavior can damage either the system or the agent in a way that breaks the learning process itself. In this work, we model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and provide a new on-policy formulation for solving it. A key contribution of our approach is to translate cumulative cost constraints into state-based constraints. Through this, we define a safe policy improvement method which maximizes returns while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every step. We provide theoretical guarantees under which the agent converges while ensuring safety over the course of training. We also highlight the computational advantages of this approach. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on safe navigation tasks and in safety-constrained versions of MuJoCo environments, with deep neural networks.}

The theory of meta-learning is still in its early stages, with several recent learning-theoretic analyses of methods such as Reptile [Nichol et al., 2018] being for \emph{convex models}. This work shows that convex-case analysis might be insufficient to understand the success of meta-learning, and that even for non-convex models it is important to look inside the optimization black-box, specifically at properties of the optimization trajectory. We construct a simple meta-learning instance that captures the problem of one-dimensional subspace learning. For the convex formulation of linear regression on this instance, we show that the new task sample complexity of any \emph{initialization-based meta-learning} algorithm is $\Omega(d)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. In contrast, for the non-convex formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, we show that both Reptile and multi-task representation learning can have new task sample complexity of $O(1)$, demonstrating a separation from convex meta-learning. Crucially, analyses of the training dynamics of these methods reveal that they can meta-learn the correct subspace onto which the data should be projected.}

In this work we show that this approach has a fundamental flaw:\\ If we do not impose regularity of the discriminator, it can exploit visually imperceptible errors of the generator to always achieve the maximal generator loss. In practice, gradient penalties are used to regularize the discriminator. However, this needs a metric on the space of images that captures visual similarity. Such a metric is not known, which explains the limited success of gradient penalties in stabilizing GANs.\\ Instead, we argue that the implicit competitive regularization (ICR) arising from the simultaneous optimization of generator and discriminator enables GANs performance. We show that opponent-aware modelling of generator and discriminator, as present in competitive gradient descent (CGD), can significantly strengthen ICR and thus stabilize GAN training without explicit regularization. In our experiments, we use an existing implementation of WGAN-GP and show that by training it with CGD without any explicit regularization, we can improve the inception score (IS) on CIFAR10, without any hyperparameter tuning.}

Based on our analysis, we then argue for mixing experience sampled from replay with on-policy experience, and propose a new trust region scheme that scales effectively to data distributions where V-trace becomes unstable. We provide extensive empirical validation of the proposed solutions on DMLab-30 and further show the benefits of this setup in two training regimes for Atari: (1) a single agent is trained up until 200M environment frames per game (2) a population of agents is trained up until 200M environment frames each and may share experience.

We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the task of Abstractive Summarization: the results obtained show that a naive application of DAS improves over the state-of-the-art methods, with further gains obtained via discriminator retraining. Moreover, we show how DAS can be effective for cross-domain adaptation.

In this work we establish a novel link between PM and the average-case analysis.

This brings a new perspective on this classical method, showing that PM is asymptotically both worst-case and average-case optimal.}

During exploration, unlike prior methods which retrospectively compute the novelty of observations after the agent has already reached them, our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning to seek out expected future novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts to multiple downstream tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging control tasks from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision or task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised exploration methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which has access to rewards.

In this paper we consider model-based RL in the tabular finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result matches previous bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions. To the best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit feedback.}

  abstract =   {We investigate the connections between neural networks and simple building blocks in kernel space. In particular, using well established feature space tools such as direct sum, averaging, and moment lifting, we present an algebra for creating ``compositional'' kernels from bags of features. We show that these operations correspond to many of the building blocks of ``neural tangent kernels (NTK)''. Experimentally, we show that there is a correlation in test error between neural network architectures and the associated kernels. We construct a simple neural network architecture using only 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 average pooling, ReLU, and optimized with SGD and MSE loss that achieves 96\% accuracy on CIFAR10, and whose corresponding compositional kernel achieves 90\% accuracy. We also use our constructions to investigate the relative performance of neural networks, NTKs, and compositional kernels in the small dataset regime. In particular, we find that compositional kernels outperform NTKs and neural networks outperform both kernel methods.}

However, this work shows that the combination of normalization and rectified linear function leads to inhibited channels, which have small magnitude and contribute little to the learned feature representation, impeding the generalization ability of CNNs. Unlike prior arts that simply removed the inhibited channels, we propose to ``wake them up'' during training by designing a novel neural building block, termed Channel Equilibrium (CE) block, which enables channels at the same layer to contribute equally to the learned representation. We show that CE is able to prevent inhibited channels both empirically and theoretically. CE has several appealing benefits. (1) It can be integrated into many advanced CNN architectures such as ResNet and MobileNet, outperforming their original networks. (2) CE has an interesting connection with the Nash Equilibrium, a well-known solution of a non-cooperative game. (3) Extensive experiments show that CE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks such as ImageNet and COCO.}

However, the existing VAE models may suffer from KL vanishing in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for disentangling. To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training. The framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling, disentangled representation learning, and image generation. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve much better reconstruction quality than the competitive methods for the comparable disentanglement performance. For language modeling, it not only averts the KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text. Finally, we also demonstrate that ControlVAE improves the reconstruction quality for image generation compared to the original VAE.}

To do this, LBQL employs previously collected experience and each iteration's state-action values as dual feasible penalties to construct a sequence of sampled information relaxation problems. The solutions to these problems provide estimated upper and lower bounds on the optimal value, which we track via stochastic approximation. These quantities are then used to constrain the iterates to stay within the bounds at every iteration. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems show that LBQL exhibits faster convergence and more robustness to hyperparameters when compared to standard Q-learning and several related techniques. Our approach is particularly appealing in problems that require expensive simulations or real-world interactions.}

Whereas the strategic classification literature has previously assumed that agents' outcomes are not causally affected by their features (and thus that strategic agents' goal is deceiving the decision-maker), we join concurrent work in modeling agents' outcomes as a function of their changeable attributes. As our main contribution, we provide efficient algorithms for learning decision rules that optimize three distinct decision-maker objectives in a realizable linear setting: accurately predicting agents' post-gaming outcomes (prediction risk minimization), incentivizing agents to improve these outcomes (agent outcome maximization), and estimating the coefficients of the true underlying model (parameter estimation). Our algorithms circumvent a hardness result of Miller et al. (2019) by allowing the decision maker to test a sequence of decision rules and observe agents' responses, in effect performing causal interventions through the decision rules.}

To present a unified treatment of these distances, we first propose a general \emph{optimistic tracking algorithm} and analyze its sample allocation performance w.r.t.~an oracle. We then instantiate this algorithm for the four distance measures and derive bounds on their regret. We also show that the allocation performance of the proposed algorithm cannot, in general, be improved, by deriving lower-bounds on the expected deviation from the oracle allocation for any adaptive scheme. We verify our theoretical findings through some experiments. Finally, we show that the techniques developed in the paper can be easily extended to learn some classes of continuous distributions as well as to the related setting of minimizing the average error (in terms of the four distances) in learning a set of distributions.}

However, as digital images and feature maps are on the discrete meshgrid, corresponding equivariance-preserving transformation groups are very limited. In this work, we deal with this issue from the connection between convolutions and partial differential operators (PDOs). In theory, assuming inputs to be smooth, we transform PDOs and propose a system which is equivariant to a much more general continuous group, the $n$-dimension Euclidean group. In implementation, we discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving approximately equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the approximation error of PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first time that the error analysis is provided when the equivariance is approximate. Extensive experiments on rotated MNIST and natural image classification show that PDO-eConvs perform competitively yet use parameters much more efficiently. Particularly, compared with Wide ResNets, our methods result in better results using only 12.6\% parameters.}

We develop a new framework --- \textbf{S}mooth \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning ($\textbf{SR}^2\textbf{L}$), where the policy is trained with smoothness-inducing regularization. Such regularization effectively constrains the search space, and enforces smoothness in the learned policy. Moreover, our proposed framework can also improve the robustness of policy against measurement error in the state space, and can be naturally extended to distribubutionally robust setting. We apply the proposed framework to both on-policy (TRPO) and off-policy algorithm (DDPG).

However, current models struggle to maintain coherent latent spaces required to perform meaningful text manipulations via latent vector operations. Specifically, we demonstrate by example that neural encoders do not necessarily map similar sentences to nearby latent vectors. A theoretical explanation for this phenomenon establishes that high-capacity autoencoders can learn an arbitrary mapping between sequences and associated latent representations. To remedy this issue, we augment adversarial autoencoders with a denoising objective where original sentences are reconstructed from perturbed versions (referred to as DAAE). We prove that this simple modification guides the latent space geometry of the resulting model by encouraging the encoder to map similar texts to similar latent representations. In empirical comparisons with various types of autoencoders, our model provides the best trade-off between generation quality and reconstruction capacity. Moreover, the improved geometry of the DAAE latent space enables \emph{zero-shot} text style transfer via simple latent vector arithmetic.}

We evaluate performance objectives that have operational meanings in practical clinical trials, including cumulative efficacy, recommendation/allocation success probabilities, toxicity violation probability, and sample efficiency. An extended SEEDA-Plateau algorithm that is tailored for the increase-then-plateau efficacy behavior of molecularly targeted agents (MTA) is also presented.

  abstract =   {The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN).This is different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by (i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and (iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions, that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN. Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL on PTB/WikiText-103. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/sIncerass/powernorm.}

In this paper, we shed light on this phenomenon: we show that the combination of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and over-parameterization makes the landscape of multilayer neural networks approximately connected and thus more favorable to optimization. More specifically, we prove that SGD solutions are connected via a piecewise linear path, and the increase in loss along this path vanishes as the number of neurons grows large. This result is a consequence of the fact that the parameters found by SGD are increasingly dropout stable as the network becomes wider. We show that, if we remove part of the neurons (and suitably rescale the remaining ones), the change in loss is independent of the total number of neurons, and it depends only on how many neurons are left. Our results exhibit a mild dependence on the input dimension: they are dimension-free for two-layer networks and require the number of neurons to scale linearly with the dimension for multilayer networks. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments for different architectures and classification tasks.}

In this paper, we propose a novel template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming a target molecular graph into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits the target molecular graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers, and then translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational graph translation framework. Experimental results show that G2Gs significantly outperforms existing template-free approaches by up to 63\% in terms of the top-1 accuracy and achieves a performance close to that of state-of-the-art template-based approaches, but does not require domain knowledge and is much more scalable.}

  abstract =   {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to rely more on local texture rather than global shape when making decisions. Recent work also indicates a close relationship between CNN's texture-bias and its robustness against distribution shift, adversarial perturbation, random corruption, etc. In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's texture bias. With inspiration from the human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Specifically, we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the local texture. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness under various scenarios (domain generalization, few-shot classification, image corruption, and adversarial perturbation). To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the earliest attempts to improve different kinds of robustness in a unified model, shedding new light on the relationship between shape-bias and robustness, also on new approaches to trustworthy machine learning algorithms.

  abstract =   {Deep generative models are commonly used for generating images and text. Interpretability of these models is one important pursuit, other than the generation quality. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE), whose mixture components could be related to hidden semantic aspects of data. In this paper, we generalize the practice and introduce DEM-VAE, a class of models for text generation using VAEs with a mixture distribution of exponential family. Unfortunately, a standard variational training algorithm fails due to the \emph{mode-collapse} problem. We theoretically identify the root cause of the problem and propose an effective algorithm to train DEM-VAE. Our method penalizes the training with an extra \emph{dispersion term} to induce a well-structured latent space. Experimental results show that our approach does obtain a meaningful space, and it outperforms strong baselines in text generation benchmarks.

Existing results relate in precise ways the sign and magnitude of the bias to various sources of data adaptivity, but do not apply to the conditional inference setting in which the sample means are computed only if some specific conditions are satisfied. In this paper, we characterize the sign of the conditional bias of monotone functions of the rewards, including the sample mean. Our results hold for arbitrary conditioning events and leverage natural monotonicity properties of the data collection policy. We further demonstrate, through several examples from sequential testing and best arm identification, that the sign of the conditional and marginal bias of the sample mean of an arm can be different, depending on the conditioning event. Our analysis offers new and interesting perspectives on the subtleties of assessing the bias in data adaptive settings.}

  abstract =   {High-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics are major challenges when applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding the observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform next-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the decoder) which are discarded during control. In this paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically that explicit next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding. We then use predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics are amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.}

Both the catastrophic impacts, e.g., tidal flooding and storm surges, and the long-term impacts, e.g., beach erosion, inundation of low lying areas, and saltwater intrusion into aquifers, cause economic, social, and ecological losses. Creating policies through appropriate modeling of the responses of stakeholders, such as government, businesses, and residents, to climate change and sea level rise scenarios can help to reduce these losses. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for an agent (government) which interacts with the environment (nature and residents) to deal with the impacts of climate change, in particular sea level rise. Through theoretical analysis we show that a reasonable government's policy on infrastructure development ought to be proactive and based on detected sea levels in order to minimize the expected total cost, as opposed to a straightforward government that reacts to observed costs from nature. We also provide a deep reinforcement learning-based scenario planning tool considering different government and resident types in terms of cooperation, and different sea level rise projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).}

In this paper, we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with bandit observational data. We propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a robust policy to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts. We first present a policy evaluation procedure in the ambiguous environment and also give a heuristic algorithm to solve the distributionally robust policy learning problems efficiently.

These are functions $f$ that may be represented as the difference $\phi_1 - \phi_2$ for a choice of \emph{convex} functions $\phi_1, \phi_2$. The method proceeds by estimating piecewise-liner convex functions, in a manner similar to max-affine regression, whose difference approximates the data. The choice of the function is regularised by a new seminorm over the class of DC functions that controls the $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz constant of the estimate. The resulting methodology can be efficiently implemented via Quadratic programming \emph{even in high dimensions}, and is shown to have close to minimax statistical risk. We empirically validate the method, showing it to be practically implementable, and to outperform existing regression methods in accuracy on real-world datasets.}

In contrast to standard (deep) reinforcement learning (RL), we investigate the problem of learning a policy that treats its users equitably. In this paper, we formulate this novel RL problem, in which an objective function, which encodes a notion of fairness that we formally define, is optimized. For this problem, we provide a theoretical discussion where we examine the case of discounted rewards and that of average rewards. During this analysis, we notably derive a new result in the standard RL setting, which is of independent interest: it states a novel bound on the approximation error with respect to the optimal average reward of that of a policy optimal for the discounted reward. Since learning with discounted rewards is generally easier, this discussion further justifies finding a fair policy for the average reward by learning a fair policy for the discounted reward. Thus, we describe how several classic deep RL algorithms can be adapted to our fair optimization problem, and we validate our approach with extensive experiments in three different domains.}

This connection allows us to generalize GMRFs to multi-layer CNN architectures, effectively increasing the order of the corresponding GMRF in a way which has favorable computational scaling. We describe how well-established tools, such as autodiff and variational inference, can be used for simple and efficient inference and learning of the deep GMRF. We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on a dataset of satellite temperatures, in terms of prediction and predictive uncertainty.}

  abstract =   {Collaborative machine learning (ML) is an appealing paradigm to build high-quality ML models by training on the aggregated data from many parties. However, these parties are only willing to share their data when given enough incentives, such as a guaranteed fair reward based on their contributions. This motivates the need for measuring a party's contribution and designing an incentive-aware reward scheme accordingly. This paper proposes to value a party's reward based on Shapley value and information gain on model parameters given its data. Subsequently, we give each party a model as a reward. To formally incentivize the collaboration, we define some desirable properties (e.g., fairness and stability) which are inspired by cooperative game theory but adapted for our model reward that is uniquely freely replicable. Then, we propose a novel model reward scheme to satisfy fairness and trade off between the desirable properties via an adjustable parameter. The value of each party's model reward determined by our scheme is attained by injecting Gaussian noise to the aggregated training data with an optimized noise variance. We empirically demonstrate interesting properties of our scheme and evaluate its performance using synthetic and real-world datasets.}

Notably, our lower bounds rule out the possibility of a $\mathrm{poly}(\log{T})$-regret algorithm, which had been conjectured due to the apparent strong convexity of the problem. Our upper bound is attained by a simple variant of certainty equivalent control, where the learner selects control inputs according to the optimal controller for their estimate of the system while injecting exploratory random noise. While this approach was shown to achieve $\sqrt{T}$ regret by Mania et al. (2019), we show that if the learner continually refines their estimates of the system matrices, the method attains optimal dimension dependence as well. Central to our upper and lower bounds is a new approach for controlling perturbations of Riccati equations called the self-bounding ODE method, which we use to derive suboptimality bounds for the certainty equivalent controller synthesized from estimated system dynamics. This in turn enables regret upper bounds which hold for any stabilizable instance and scale with natural control-theoretic quantities.}

Our reward function is directly based on fundamental physical properties such as the energy, which we approximate via fast quantum-chemical methods.

While there is a rich theory of SGDm for convex problems, the theory is considerably less developed in the context of deep learning where the problem is non-convex and the gradient noise might exhibit a heavy-tailed behavior, as empirically observed in recent studies. In this study, we consider a \emph{continuous-time} variant of SGDm, known as the underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD), and investigate its asymptotic properties under heavy-tailed perturbations. Supported by recent studies from statistical physics, we argue both theoretically and empirically that the heavy-tails of such perturbations can result in a bias even when the step-size is small, in the sense that \emph{the optima of stationary distribution} of the dynamics might not match \emph{the optima of the cost function to be optimized}. As a remedy, we develop a novel framework, which we coin as \emph{fractional} ULD (FULD), and prove that FULD targets the so-called Gibbs distribution, whose optima exactly match the optima of the original cost. We observe that the Euler discretization of FULD has noteworthy algorithmic similarities with \emph{natural gradient} methods and \emph{gradient clipping}, bringing a new perspective on understanding their role in deep learning. We support our theory with experiments conducted on a synthetic model and neural networks.}

For \emph{any} perturbation of the input with a magnitude smaller than the certificate value, the classification output will provably remain unchanged. Computing exact robustness certificates for neural networks is difficult in general since it requires solving a non-convex optimization. In this paper, we provide computationally-efficient robustness certificates for neural networks with differentiable activation functions in two steps. First, we show that if the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the network (curvatures of the network) are bounded (globally or locally), we can compute a robustness certificate in the $l_2$ norm efficiently using convex optimization. Second, we derive a computationally-efficient differentiable upper bound on the curvature of a deep network. We also use the curvature bound as a regularization term during the training of the network to boost its certified robustness. Putting these results together leads to our proposed {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obustness {\bf C}ertificate (CRC) and {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obust {\bf T}raining (CRT). Our numerical results show that CRT leads to significantly higher certified robust accuracy compared to interval-bound propagation based training.}

First, to generate a realistic, diverse set of opponents, we develop a novel method for self-play based on replica-exchange Markov chain Monte Carlo. Second, we propose a distributionally robust bandit optimization procedure that adaptively adjusts risk aversion relative to uncertainty in beliefs about opponents' behaviors.

This finding is interesting but also discouraging -- large batch sizes are slow and expensive to emulate on conventional hardware. Thus, it would be nice if there were some trick by which we could generate batches that were effectively big though small in practice. In this work, we propose such a trick, inspired by the use of Coreset-selection in active learning. When training a GAN, we draw a large batch of samples from the prior and then compress that batch using Coreset-selection. To create effectively large batches of real images, we create a cached dataset of Inception activations of each training image, randomly project them down to a smaller dimension, and then use Coreset-selection on those projected embeddings at training time. We conduct experiments showing that this technique substantially reduces training time and memory usage for modern GAN variants, that it reduces the fraction of dropped modes in a synthetic dataset, and that it helps us use GANs to reach a new state of the art in anomaly detection.}

We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Using the Concentration Phenomenon, we explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can attribute the anomaly to specific dimensions within the anomalous state vector. We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural network classifiers yield significantly higher AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art approaches against benchmark anomaly detection datasets, and a multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate control devices.

In this work, we consider a smoothed setting for structured linear contextual bandits where the adversarial contexts are perturbed by Gaussian noise and the unknown parameter $\theta^*$ has structure, e.g., sparsity, group sparsity, low rank, etc. We propose simple greedy algorithms for both the single- and multi-parameter (i.e., different parameter for each context) settings and provide a unified regret analysis for $\theta^*$ with any assumed structure. The regret bounds are expressed in terms of geometric quantities such as Gaussian widths associated with the structure of $\theta^*$. We also obtain sharper regret bounds compared to earlier work for the unstructured $\theta^*$ setting as a consequence of our improved analysis. We show there is implicit exploration in the smoothed setting where a simple greedy algorithm works.}

In this work, we argue that a fair assessment of optimizers' performance must take the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning into account, i.e., how easy it is to find good hyperparameter configurations using an automatic hyperparameter search. Evaluating a variety of optimizers on an extensive set of standard datasets and architectures, our results indicate that Adam is the most practical solution, particularly in low-budget scenarios.}

We find empirically that the explanations of all mentioned methods, except for DeepLIFT, are independent of the parameters of later layers. We provide theoretical insights for this surprising behavior and also analyze why DeepLIFT does not suffer from this limitation.

In this paper, we perform carefully designed experiments and rigorous hyperparameter sweeps on a range of popular models, which verify that small or moderately large batch sizes can substantially outperform very large batches on the test set. This occurs even when both models are trained for the same number of iterations and large batches achieve smaller training losses. Our results confirm that the noise in stochastic gradients can enhance generalization. We study how the optimal learning rate schedule changes as the epoch budget grows, and we provide a theoretical account of our observations based on the stochastic differential equation perspective of SGD dynamics.}

To overcome this limitation, we propose an new training objective where we additionally optimize over a set of importance weights over the generated samples. By suitably constraining the feasible set of importance weights, we obtain a family of objectives which includes and generalizes the original f-GAN and WGAN objectives. We show that a natural extension outperforms WGANs while providing density ratios as in f-GAN, and demonstrate empirical success on distribution modeling, density ratio estimation and image generation.}

We propose new model-based mechanisms that are able to make online adaptation in unseen target environments, by combining ideas from no-regret online learning and adaptive control. We prove that the approach learns policies in the target environment that can quickly recover trajectories from the source environment, and establish the rate of convergence in general settings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach for policy adaptation in a diverse set of continuous control tasks, achieving the performance of state-of-the-art methods with much lower sample complexity.

Contrary to the existing methods that learn only the representation of a 3D object, our approach simultaneously finds a representation of the object and its 3D surfaces. The main idea of our HyperCloud method is to build a hyper network that returns weights of a particular neural network (target network) trained to map points from a uniform unit ball distribution into a 3D shape. As a consequence, a particular 3D shape can be generated using point-by-point sampling from the assumed prior distribution and transforming sampled points with the target network. Since the hyper network is based on an auto-encoder architecture trained to reconstruct realistic 3D shapes, the target network weights can be considered a parametrisation of the surface of a 3D shape, and not a standard representation of point cloud usually returned by competitive approaches. The proposed architecture allows to find mesh-based representation of 3D objects in a generative manner, while providing point clouds en pair in quality with the state-of-the-art methods.}

For example, high obesity is generally predictive for heart disease, but this relation may not hold for smokers who generally have lower rates of obesity and higher rates of heart disease. We present a framework for making models robust to spurious correlations by leveraging humans' common sense knowledge of causality. Specifically, we use human annotation to augment each training example with a potential unmeasured variable (i.e. an underweight patient with heart disease may be a smoker), reducing the problem to a covariate shift problem. We then introduce a new distributionally robust optimization objective over unmeasured variables (UV-DRO) to control the worst-case loss over possible test- time shifts. Empirically, we show improvements of 5--10\% on a digit recognition task confounded by rotation, and 1.5--5\% on the task of analyzing NYPD Police Stops confounded by location.}

We study task cooperation and competition in several different learning settings and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing tasks are computed by different networks. Our framework offers a time-accuracy trade-off and can produce better accuracy using less inference time than not only a single large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks.}

We take a controls perspective, wherein the traditional Lagrange multiplier update behaves as \emph{integral} control; our terms introduce \emph{proportional} and \emph{derivative} control, achieving favorable learning dynamics through damping and predictive measures. We apply our PID Lagrangian methods in deep RL, setting a new state of the art in Safety Gym, a safe RL benchmark. Lastly, we introduce a new method to ease controller tuning by providing invariance to the relative numerical scales of reward and cost. Our extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance and hyperparameter robustness, while our algorithms remain nearly as simple to derive and implement as the traditional Lagrangian approach.}

Typically robustness does not generalize to previously unseen threat models, e.g., other $L_p$ norms, or larger perturbations. Our confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) tackles this problem by biasing the model towards low confidence predictions on adversarial examples. By allowing to reject examples with low confidence, robustness generalizes beyond the threat model employed during training. CCAT, trained only on $L_\infty$ adversarial examples, increases robustness against larger $L_\infty$, $L_2$, $L_1$ and $L_0$ attacks, adversarial frames, distal adversarial examples and corrupted examples and yields better clean accuracy compared to adversarial training. For thorough evaluation we developed novel white- and black-box attacks directly attacking CCAT by maximizing confidence. For each threat model, we use $7$ attacks with up to $50$ restarts and $5000$ iterations and report worst-case robust test error, extended to our confidence-thresholded setting, across all attacks.}

We theoretically proved the feasibility of the CSL framework and designed an iterative algorithm to distinguish between tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our CSL methods could achieve a human-like task understanding without task labeling in multi-function regression problems and multi-task recognition problems.}

We show that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We then differentiate \emph{through the entire learning process} via meta-gradients to update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. This paper introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for neural architecture search (NAS). GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art, finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the art approaches, which achieve top performance while using orders of magnitude less computation than typical NAS methods. Speculating forward, GTNs may represent a first step toward the ambitious goal of algorithms that generate their own training data and, in doing so, open a variety of interesting new research questions and directions.}

Recent works have shown that utilizing both decentralized computing and local stochastic gradient estimates can outperform state-of-the-art centralized algorithms, in applications involving highly non-convex problems, such as training deep neural networks. 	 In this work, we propose a decentralized stochastic algorithm to deal with certain smooth non-convex problems where there are $m$ nodes in the system, and each node has a large number of samples (denoted as $n$). Differently from the majority of the existing decentralized learning algorithms for either stochastic or finite-sum problems, our focus is given to \emph{both} reducing the total communication rounds among the nodes, while accessing the minimum number of local data samples. In particular, we propose an algorithm named D-GET (decentralized gradient estimation and tracking), which jointly performs decentralized gradient estimation (which estimates the local gradient using a subset of local samples) \emph{and} gradient tracking (which tracks the global full gradient using local estimates). We show that to achieve certain $\epsilon$ stationary solution of the deterministic finite sum problem, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}(mn^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication complexity. These bounds significantly improve upon the best existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(mn\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, respectively. Similarly, for online problems, the proposed method achieves an $\mathcal{O}(m \epsilon^{-3/2})$ sample complexity and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication complexity.}

Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce the latency by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due to a difficulty in dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation. This paper proposes a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model learns to approximate the regularized posterior of the NAR model. In the M-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior and selects the training examples for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively guide the system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation. We evaluate our method on the task of machine translation. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if not better, performance with existing NAR models and significantly reduces the inference latency.}

  abstract =   {The attribution problem, that is the problem of attributing a model's prediction to its base features, is well-studied. We extend the notion of attribution to also apply to feature interactions. The Shapley value is a commonly used method to attribute a model's prediction to its base features. We propose a generalization of the Shapley value called Shapley-Taylor index that attributes the model's prediction to interactions of subsets of features up to some size $k$. The method is analogous to how the truncated Taylor Series decomposes the function value at a certain point using its derivatives at a different point. In fact, we show that the Shapley Taylor index is equal to the Taylor Series of the multilinear extension of the set-theoretic behavior of the model. We axiomatize this method using the standard Shapley axioms---linearity, dummy, symmetry and efficiency---and an additional axiom that we call the interaction distribution axiom. This new axiom explicitly characterizes how interactions are distributed for a class of functions that model pure interaction. We contrast the Shapley-Taylor index against the previously proposed Shapley Interaction index from the cooperative game theory literature. We also apply the Shapley Taylor index to three models and identify interesting qualitative insights.}

The use of the Shapley value is justified by citing the uniqueness result from~\cite{Shapley53}, which shows that it is the only method that satisfies certain good properties (\emph{axioms}). There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value is operationalized for model explanation. These differ in how they reference the model, the training data, and the explanation context. Hence they differ in output, rendering the uniqueness result inapplicable. Furthermore, the techniques that rely on they training data produce non-intuitive attributions, for instance unused features can still receive attribution. In this paper, we use the axiomatic approach to study the differences between some of the many operationalizations of the Shapley value for attribution. We discuss a technique called Baseline Shapley (BShap), provide a proper uniqueness result for it, and contrast it with two other techniques from prior literature, Integrated Gradients~\cite{STY17} and Conditional Expectation Shapley~\cite{Lundberg2017AUA}.}

We show that our entropy evaluation can be reduced to a closed form whose computation is quite simple while capturing the trade-off relation in Pareto-frontier. We further propose an extension for the ``decoupled'' setting, in which each objective function can be observed separately, and show that the PFES-based approach derives a natural extension of the original acquisition function which can also be evaluated simply.

Recent work developing this class of methods has explored ever richer parameterizations of the approximate posterior in the hope of improving performance. In contrast, here we share a curious experimental finding that suggests instead restricting the variational distribution to a more compact parameterization. For a variety of deep Bayesian neural networks trained using Gaussian mean-field variational inference, we find that the posterior standard deviations consistently exhibit strong low-rank structure after convergence. This means that by decomposing these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization, we can make our variational approximation more compact without decreasing the models' performance. Furthermore, we find that such factorized parameterizations improve the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the variational lower bound, resulting in faster convergence.}

This is a complex problem that has a wide range of applications in fleet management to achieve a common goal, such as mapping from a swarm of robots and ride sharing. Traditional methods are typically not designed for realistic environments which contain sparsely connected graphs and unknown traffic, and are often too slow in runtime to be practical. In contrast, we propose a graph neural network based model that is able to perform multi-agent routing based on learned value iteration in a sparsely connected graph with dynamically changing traffic conditions. Moreover, our learned communication module enables the agents to coordinate online and adapt to changes more effectively. We created a simulated environment to mimic realistic mapping performed by autonomous vehicles with unknown minimum edge coverage and traffic conditions; our approach significantly outperforms traditional solvers both in terms of total cost and runtime. We also show that our model trained with only two agents on graphs with a maximum of 25 nodes can easily generalize to situations with more agents and/or nodes.}

Based on this theory, we develop Bivariate Quantile Causal Discovery (bQCD), a new method to distinguish cause from effect assuming no confounding, selection bias or feedback. Because it uses multiple quantile levels instead of the conditional mean only, bQCD is adaptive not only to additive, but also to multiplicative or even location-scale generating mechanisms. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform an extensive empirical comparison on both synthetic and real datasets. This study shows that bQCD is robust across different implementations of the method (i.e., the quantile regression), computationally efficient, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.}

Further, we also propose a parallelization of MF-MES mainly for the asynchronous setting because queries typically occur asynchronously in MFBO due to a variety of sampling costs.

We show several useful properties of the Fiedler value that make it suitable for regularization. We provide an approximate, variational approach for faster computation during training. We provide an alternative formulation of this framework in the form of a structurally weighted L1 penalty, thus linking our approach to sparsity induction. We performed experiments on datasets that compare Fiedler regularization with traditional regularization methods such as Dropout and weight decay. Results demonstrate the efficacy of Fiedler regularization.}

Empirically, we show that DropNet is robust across a wide range of scenarios, including MLPs and CNNs using the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. We show that up to 90\% of the nodes/filters can be removed without any significant loss of accuracy. The final pruned network performs well even with reinitialisation of the weights and biases. DropNet also achieves similar accuracy to an oracle which greedily removes nodes/filters one at a time to minimise training loss, highlighting its effectiveness.}

The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show that our trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial IP solvers.}

Despite the popularity of this setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been sparsely studied in general SSP problems, with most of the theoretical literature focusing on different problems (i.e., fixed-horizon and infinite-horizon) or making the restrictive loop-free SSP assumption (i.e., no state can be visited twice during an episode). In this paper, we study the general SSP problem with no assumption on its dynamics (some policies may actually never reach the goal). We introduce UC-SSP, the first no-regret algorithm in this setting, and prove a regret bound scaling as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( D S \sqrt{ A D K})$ after $K$ episodes for any unknown SSP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, positive costs and SSP-diameter $D$, defined as the smallest expected hitting time from any starting state to the goal. We achieve this result by crafting a novel stopping rule, such that UC-SSP may interrupt the current policy if it is taking too long to achieve the goal and switch to alternative policies that are designed to rapidly terminate the episode.}

Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation prediction framework, GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and has a strong inductive bias to learn entity-independent relational semantics. Unlike embedding-based models, GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize to unseen entities and graphs after training. We provide theoretical proof and strong empirical evidence that GraIL can rep-resent a useful subset of first-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms existing rule-induction baselines in the inductive setting.

However, these assumptions may preclude the possibility of adaptation from intricately shifted and apparently very different distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose mechanism transfer, a meta-distributional scenario in which a data generating mechanism is invariant among domains. This transfer assumption can accommodate nonparametric shifts resulting in apparently different distributions while providing a solid statistical basis for DA. We take the structural equations in causal modeling as an example and propose a novel DA method, which is shown to be useful both theoretically and experimentally. Our method can be seen as the first attempt to fully leverage the invariance of structural causal models for DA.}

  abstract =   {We consider a deep ReLU / Leaky ReLU student network trained from the output of a fixed teacher network of the same depth, with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The student network is \emph{over-realized}: at each layer $l$, the number $n_l$ of student nodes is more than that ($m_l$) of teacher. Under mild conditions on dataset and teacher network, we prove that when the gradient is small at every data sample, each teacher node is \emph{specialized} by at least one student node \emph{at the lowest layer}. For two-layer network, such specialization can be achieved by training on any dataset of \emph{polynomial} size $\mathcal{O}( K^{5/2} d^3 \epsilon^{-1})$. until the gradient magnitude drops to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon/K^{3/2}\sqrt{d})$. Here $d$ is the input dimension, $K = m_1 + n_1$ is the total number of neurons in the lowest layer of teacher and student. Note that we require a specific form of data augmentation and the sample complexity includes the additional data generated from augmentation. To our best knowledge, we are the first to give polynomial sample complexity for student specialization of training two-layer (Leaky) ReLU networks with finite depth and width in teacher-student setting, and finite complexity for the lowest layer specialization in multi-layer case, without parametric assumption of the input (like Gaussian). Our theory suggests that teacher nodes with large fan-out weights get specialized first when the gradient is still large, while others are specialized with small gradient, which suggests inductive bias in training. This shapes the stage of training as empirically observed in multiple previous works. Experiments on synthetic and CIFAR10 verify our findings.

  abstract =   {We are interested in how to design reinforcement learning agents that provably reduce the sample complexity for learning new tasks by transferring knowledge from previously-solved ones. The availability of solutions to related problems poses a fundamental trade-off: whether to seek policies that are expected to immediately achieve high (yet sub-optimal) performance in the new task or whether to seek information to quickly identify an optimal solution, potentially at the cost of poor initial behaviour. In this work, we focus on the second objective when the agent has access to a generative model of state-action pairs. First, given a set of solved tasks containing an approximation of the target one, we design an algorithm that quickly identifies an accurate solution by seeking the state-action pairs that are most informative for this purpose. We derive PAC bounds on its sample complexity which clearly demonstrate the benefits of using this kind of prior knowledge. Then, we show how to learn these approximate tasks sequentially by reducing our transfer setting to a hidden Markov model and employing spectral methods to recover its parameters. Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical findings in simple simulated domains.}

  abstract =   {We introduce a class of auto-encoder neural networks tailored to data from the natural exponential family (e.g., count data). The architectures are inspired by the problem of learning the filters in a convolutional generative model with sparsity constraints, often referred to as convolutional dictionary learning (CDL). Our work is the first to combine ideas from convolutional generative models and deep learning for data that are naturally modeled with a non-Gaussian distribution (e.g., binomial and Poisson). This perspective provides us with a scalable and flexible framework that can be re-purposed for a wide range of tasks and assumptions on the generative model. Specifically, the iterative optimization procedure for solving CDL, an unsupervised task, is mapped to an unfolded and constrained neural network, with iterative adjustments to the inputs to account for the generative distribution. We also show that the framework can easily be extended for discriminative training, appropriate for a supervised task. We 1) demonstrate that fitting the generative model to learn, in an unsupervised fashion, the latent stimulus that underlies neural spiking data leads to better goodness-of-fit compared to other baselines, 2) show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for supervised Poisson image denoising, with significantly fewer parameters, and 3) characterize the gradient dynamics of the shallow binomial auto-encoder.}

In this paper, we explore their benefits in model-free RL, when employed using multi-step dynamic programming algorithms: $\kappa$-Policy Iteration ($\kappa$-PI) and $\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods iteratively compute the next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI) by solving a surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount factor. We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI in which the surrogate problem can be solved by any discrete or continuous action RL method, such as DQN and TRPO. We identify the importance of a hyper-parameter that controls the extent to which the surrogate problem is solved and suggest a way to set this parameter. When evaluated on a range of Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks, our results indicate that for the right range of $\kappa$, our algorithms outperform DQN and TRPO. This shows that our multi-step greedy algorithms are general enough to be applied over any existing RL algorithm and can significantly improve its performance.}

Furthermore, there are usually heterogeneous preferences, either at an individual level within small groups or within sub-populations of large groups. Given the availability of choice data, there are now many models that capture this behavior in order to make effective predictions---however, there is little work in understanding how directly changing the choice set can be used to influence the preferences of a collection of decision-makers. Here, we use discrete choice modeling to develop an optimization framework of such interventions for several problems of group influence, namely maximizing agreement or disagreement and promoting a particular choice. We show that these problems are NP-hard in general, but imposing restrictions reveals a fundamental boundary: promoting a choice can be easier than encouraging consensus or sowing discord. We design approximation algorithms for the hard problems and show that they work well on real-world choice data.}

Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model non-linear paths common in many underlying dynamic systems. We establish a link between continuous normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport to model the expected paths of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution. We present \emph{TrajectoryNet}, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.}

Such privacy risks are exacerbated when a model is used for predictions on an unseen data distribution. To alleviate privacy attacks, we demonstrate the benefit of predictive models that are based on the causal relationships between input features and the outcome. We first show that models learnt using causal structure generalize better to unseen data, especially on data from different distributions than the train distribution. Based on this generalization property, we establish a theoretical link between causality and privacy: compared to associational models, causal models provide stronger differential privacy guarantees and are more robust to membership inference attacks. Experiments on simulated Bayesian networks and the colored-MNIST dataset show that associational models exhibit upto 80\% attack accuracy under different test distributions and sample sizes whereas causal models exhibit attack accuracy close to a random guess.}

To deal with this, we introduce a sparse variational approach with inducing tensors.

This paper studies a complementary failure mode, \emph{invariance-based} adversarial examples, that introduce minimal semantic changes that modify an input's true label yet preserve the model's prediction. We demonstrate fundamental tradeoffs between these two types of adversarial examples. We show that defenses against sensitivity-based attacks actively harm a model's accuracy on invariance-based attacks, and that new approaches are needed to resist both attack types. In particular, we break state-of-the-art adversarially-trained and \emph{certifiably-robust} models by generating small perturbations that the models are (provably) robust to, yet that change an input's class according to human labelers. Finally, we formally show that the existence of excessively invariant classifiers arises from the presence of \emph{overly-robust} predictive features in standard datasets.}

In the finite sum case, we also estimate $\BigO{\varepsilon^{-2}}$ iteration-complexity and the total oracle calls with high probability.

We also derive a general privacy accounting method under BDP, building upon the well-known moments accountant. Our experiments demonstrate that in-distribution samples in classic machine learning datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, enjoy significantly stronger privacy guarantees than postulated by DP, while models maintain high classification accuracy.}

We then provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ prediction error of two transductive prediction rules.

The learned objective can serve as an explanation for the observed graph properties, thereby lending itself to transfer across different graphs within a domain. GraphOpt poses link formation in graphs as a sequential decision-making process and solves it using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. Further, it employs a novel continuous latent action space that aids scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that GraphOpt discovers a latent objective transferable across graphs with different characteristics. GraphOpt also learns a robust stochastic policy that achieves competitive link prediction performance without being explicitly trained on this task and further enables construction of graphs with properties similar to those of the observed graph.}

The rationale lies in exploiting high-performance but unknown ML models to gain learning capability for transfer learning. Using zeroth order optimization and multi-label mapping techniques, BAR can reprogram a black-box ML model solely based on its input-output responses without knowing the model architecture or changing any parameter. More importantly, in the limited medical data setting, on autism spectrum disorder classification, diabetic retinopathy detection, and melanoma detection tasks, BAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields comparable performance to the vanilla adversarial reprogramming method requiring complete knowledge of the target ML model. BAR also outperforms baseline transfer learning approaches by a significant margin, demonstrating cost-effective means and new insights for transfer learning.}

Two popular enhancements are stacked RNNs, which increases the capacity for learning non-linear functions, and bidirectional processing, which exploits acausal information in a sequence. In this work, we explore the delayed-RNN, which is a single-layer RNN that has a delay between the input and output. We prove that a weight-constrained version of the delayed-RNN is equivalent to a stacked-RNN. We also show that the delay gives rise to partial acausality, much like bidirectional networks. Synthetic experiments confirm that the delayed-RNN can mimic bidirectional networks, solving some acausal tasks similarly, and outperforming them in others. Moreover, we show similar performance to bidirectional networks in a real-world natural language processing task. These results suggest that delayed-RNNs can approximate topologies including stacked RNNs, bidirectional RNNs, and stacked bidirectional RNNs -- but with equivalent or faster runtimes for the delayed-RNNs.}

  abstract =   {The representation of the approximate posterior is a critical aspect of effective variational autoencoders (VAEs). Poor choices for the approximate posterior have a detrimental impact on the generative performance of VAEs due to the mismatch with the true posterior. We extend the class of posterior models that may be learned by using undirected graphical models. We develop an efficient method to train undirected approximate posteriors by showing that the gradient of the training objective with respect to the parameters of the undirected posterior can be computed by backpropagation through Markov chain Monte Carlo updates. We apply these gradient estimators for training discrete VAEs with Boltzmann machines as approximate posteriors and demonstrate that undirected models outperform previous results obtained using directed graphical models. Our implementation is publicly available.}

By enforcing detectability of changes in the input using a gradient penalty, we are able to reliably detect out of distribution data.

  abstract =   {Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology, medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to generate a chemical reaction network that can discriminate between different virus types based on gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.}

  abstract =   {Stochastic linear bandits are a natural and well-studied model for structured exploration/exploitation problems and are widely used in applications such as on-line marketing and recommendation. One of the main challenges faced by practitioners hoping to apply existing algorithms is that usually the feedback is randomly delayed and delays are only partially observable. For example, while a purchase is usually observable some time after the display, the decision of not buying is never explicitly sent to the system. In other words, the learner only observes delayed positive events. We formalize this problem as a novel stochastic delayed linear bandit and propose OTFLinUCB and OTFLinTS, two computationally efficient algorithms able to integrate new information as it becomes available and to deal with the permanently censored feedback. We prove optimal O(d\sqrt{T}) bounds on the regret of the first algorithm and study the dependency on delay-dependent parameters. Our model, assumptions and results are validated by experiments on simulated and real data.}

While mitigating the effects of delays in learning is well-understood in stationary environments, the problem becomes much more challenging when the environment changes. In fact, if the timescale of the change is comparable to the delay, it is impossible to learn about the environment, since the available observations are already obsolete. However, the arising issues can be addressed if intermediate signals are available without delay, such that given those signals, the long-term behavior of the system is stationary. To model this situation, we introduce the problem of stochastic, non-stationary, delayed bandits with intermediate observations. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm based on UCRL, and prove sublinear regret guarantees for its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to learn in non-stationary delayed environments where existing methods fail.}

It turns out that most current deep reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently explore the strategy space, thus learning policies that generalise poorly to unseen opponents. We then propose a novel hierarchical agent architecture, where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic structure of the game -- the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents, while the low level implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding facilitates credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show that the proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents, while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.}

As a consequence, research into interpretable machine learning has rapidly grown in an attempt to better control and fix possible sources of mistakes and biases. Tree ensembles, in particular, offer a good prediction quality in various domains, but the concurrent use of multiple trees reduces the interpretability of the ensemble. Against this background, we study born-again tree ensembles, i.e., the process of constructing a single decision tree of minimum size that reproduces the exact same behavior as a given tree ensemble in its entire feature space. To find such a tree, we develop a dynamic-programming based algorithm that exploits sophisticated pruning and bounding rules to reduce the number of recursive calls. This algorithm generates optimal born-again trees for many datasets of practical interest, leading to classifiers which are typically simpler and more interpretable without any other form of compromise.}

All three algorithms are \emph{oracle-efficient} in the sense that they are computationally efficient when given access to an optimization oracle. Such an oracle can be implemented using many existing (non-private) optimization tools such as sophisticated integer program solvers. While the accuracy of the synthetic data is contingent on the oracle's optimization performance, the algorithms satisfy differential privacy even in the worst case. For all three algorithms, we provide theoretical guarantees for both accuracy and privacy. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our methods scale well with both the dimensionality of the data and the number of queries. Compared to the state-of-the-art method High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (McKenna et al.~VLDB 2018), our algorithms provide better accuracy in the large workload and high privacy regime (corresponding to low privacy loss $\eps$).}

Our algorithms rely on variance reduction and smoothing used in conjunction with conditional gradient steps, and are accompanied by rigorous convergence guarantees. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided for illustrating the practical performance of the methods.}

Moving in these directions corresponds to human-interpretable image transformations, such as zooming or recoloring, enabling a more controllable generation process. However, the discovery of such directions is currently performed in a supervised manner, requiring human labels, pretrained models, or some form of self-supervision. These requirements severely restrict a range of directions existing approaches can discover. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised method to identify interpretable directions in the latent space of a pretrained GAN model. By a simple model-agnostic procedure, we find directions corresponding to sensible semantic manipulations without any form of (self-)supervision. Furthermore, we reveal several non-trivial findings, which would be difficult to obtain by existing methods, e.g., a direction corresponding to background removal. As an immediate practical benefit of our work, we show how to exploit this finding to achieve competitive performance for weakly-supervised saliency detection. The implementation of our method is available online.}

In our method, the agent first learns safety constraints by expanding the safe region, and then optimizes the cumulative reward in the certified safe region. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the satisfaction of the safety constraint and the near-optimality of the cumulative reward under proper regularity assumptions. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SNO-MDP through two experiments: one uses a synthetic data in a new, openly-available environment named GP-Safety-Gym, and the other simulates Mars surface exploration by using real observation data.}

We consider traditional branched networks as well as a new class of re- cursively nested networks. Our new optimizer, Orthogonalized SGD, dynamically re-balances task-specific gradients when training a multitask network.

Experi- ments demonstrate that training with Orthogonal- ized SGD significantly improves generalization accuracy of anytime networks.}

However, in each round, the local learners of D-OCG need to communicate with their neighbors to share the local gradients, which results in a high communication complexity of $O(T)$. In this paper, we first propose an improved variant of D-OCG, namely D-BOCG, which enjoys an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret bound with only $O(\sqrt{T})$ communication complexity. The key idea is to divide the total prediction rounds into $\sqrt{T}$ equally-sized blocks, and only update the local learners at the beginning of each block by performing iterative linear optimization steps. Furthermore, to handle the more challenging bandit setting, in which only the loss value is available, we incorporate the classical one-point gradient estimator into D-BOCG, and obtain similar theoretical guarantees.}

We first derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the unknown parameter, which shows that the asymptotic variance convergences to zero in a rate of the inverse of the number of the events instead of the inverse of the full data sample size, indicating that the available information in rare events data is at the scale of the number of events instead of the full data sample size. Furthermore, we prove that under-sampling a small proportion of the nonevents, the resulting under-sampled estimator may have identical asymptotic distribution to the full data MLE. This demonstrates the advantage of under-sampling nonevents for rare events data, because this procedure may significantly reduce the computation and/or data collection costs. Another common practice in analyzing rare events data is to over-sample (replicate) the events, which has a higher computational cost. We show that this procedure may even result in efficiency loss in terms of parameter estimation.}

Despite its empirical success, MAML remains less understood in theory, especially in terms of its global optimality, due to the nonconvexity of the meta-objective (the outer-level objective). To bridge such a gap between theory and practice, we characterize the optimality gap of the stationary points attained by MAML for both reinforcement learning and supervised learning, where the inner-level and outer-level problems are solved via first-order optimization methods. In particular, our characterization connects the optimality gap of such stationary points with (i) the functional geometry of inner-level objectives and (ii) the representation power of function approximators, including linear models and neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the global optimality of MAML with nonconvex meta-objectives for the first time.}

Despite the success of the existing methods, the valuable temporal information are severely underused. The timestamps of the interactions are either ignored or discretized into crude steps. The recent work although formulates event-tensors to keep the timestamps in factorization and can capture mutual excitation effects among the interaction events, it overlooks another important type of temporal influence, inhibition. In addition, it uses a local window to exclude all the long-term dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-modulating nonparametric Bayesian factorization model. We use the latent factors to construct mutually governed, general random point processes, which can capture various short-term/long-term, excitation/inhibition effects, so as to encode the complex temporal dependencies into factor representations. In addition, our model couples with a latent Gaussian process to estimate and fuse nonlinear yet static relationships between the entities. For efficient inference, we derive a fully decomposed model evidence lower bound to dispense with the huge kernel matrix and costly summations inside the rate and log rate functions. We then develop an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm. We show the advantage of our method in four real-world applications.}

However, none of these methods can efficiently verify the quality of the solutions via comparing current objective values with their dual bounds, especially in model-free case. We propose a new framework that finds out upper (dual) bounds for the sparse PCA within polynomial time via solving a convex integer program (IP). We show that, in the worst-case, the dual bounds provided by the convex IP is within an affine function of the global optimal value. Moreover, in contrast to the semi-definition relaxation, this framework is much easier to scale on large cases. Numerical results on both artificial and real cases are reported to demonstrate the advantages of our method.}

In this paper, we synergize these two paradigms and propose a role-oriented MARL framework (ROMA). In this framework, roles are emergent, and agents with similar roles tend to share their learning and to be specialized on certain sub-tasks. To this end, we construct a stochastic role embedding space by introducing two novel regularizers and conditioning individual policies on roles. Experiments show that our method can learn specialized, dynamic, and identifiable roles, which help our method push forward the state of the art on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.

  abstract =   {We describe a framework for constructing nonstationary nonseparable random fields based on an infinite mixture of convolved stochastic processes. When the mixing process is stationary but the convolution function is nonstationary we arrive at nonseparable kernels with constant non-separability that are available in closed form. When the mixing is nonstationary and the convolution function is stationary we arrive at nonseparable random fields that have varying nonseparability and better preserve local structure. These fields have natural interpretations through the spectral representation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and are demonstrated on a range of synthetic benchmarks and spatio-temporal applications in geostatistics and machine learning. We show how a single Gaussian process (GP) with these random fields can computationally and statistically outperform both separable and existing nonstationary nonseparable approaches such as treed GPs and deep GP constructions.}

  abstract =   {Existing domain adaptation focuses on transferring knowledge between domains with categorical indices (e.g., between datasets A and B). However, many tasks involve continuously indexed domains. For example, in medical applications, one often needs to transfer disease analysis and prediction across patients of different ages, where age acts as a continuous domain index. Such tasks are challenging for prior domain adaptation methods since they ignore the underlying relation among domains. In this paper, we propose the first method for continuously indexed domain adaptation. Our approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with a novel discriminator that models the encoding-conditioned domain index distribution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging the domain index to generate invariant features across a continuous range of domains. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaption methods on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets.}

  abstract =   {We consider the problem of the limited-bandwidth communication for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents cooperate with the assistance of a communication protocol and a scheduler. The protocol and scheduler jointly determine which agent is communicating what message and to whom. Under the limited bandwidth constraint, a communication protocol is required to generate informative messages. Meanwhile, an unnecessary communication connection should not be established because it occupies limited resources in vain. In this paper, we develop an Informative Multi-Agent Communication (IMAC) method to learn efficient communication protocols as well as scheduling. First, from the perspective of communication theory, we prove that the limited bandwidth constraint requires low-entropy messages throughout the transmission. Then inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we learn a valuable and compact communication protocol and a weight-based scheduler. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method, we conduct extensive experiments in various cooperative and competitive multi-agent tasks with different numbers of agents and different bandwidths. We show that IMAC converges faster and leads to efficient communication among agents under the limited bandwidth as compared to many baseline methods.}

We find that fine-tuning only the last layer of existing detectors on rare classes is crucial to the few-shot object detection task. Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2~20 points on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS. Again, our fine-tuning approach establishes a new state of the art on the revised benchmarks. The code as well as the pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ucbdrive/few-shot-object-detection.}

We prove that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss optimizes these properties, and analyze their positive effects on downstream tasks. Empirically, we introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property. Extensive experiments on standard vision and language datasets confirm the strong agreement between both metrics and downstream task performance. Directly optimizing for these two metrics leads to representations with comparable or better performance at downstream tasks than contrastive learning.}

A recent step in this direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means.}

In these tasks, graph pooling is a critical ingredient by which GNNs adapt to input graphs of varying size and structure. We propose a new graph pooling operation based on compressive Haar transforms --- \emph{HaarPooling}. HaarPooling implements a cascade of pooling operations; it is computed by following a sequence of clusterings of the input graph. A HaarPooling layer transforms a given input graph to an output graph with a smaller node number and the same feature dimension; the compressive Haar transform filters out fine detail information in the Haar wavelet domain. In this way, all the HaarPooling layers together synthesize the features of any given input graph into a feature vector of uniform size. Such transforms provide a sparse characterization of the data and preserve the structure information of the input graph. GNNs implemented with standard graph convolution layers and HaarPooling layers achieve state of the art performance on diverse graph classification and regression problems.}

Previous studies assume that all the labels in the learning process are fixed and static; however, they ignore the fact that the labels will emerge continuously in changing environments. In order to fill in these research gaps, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based framework, Deep Streaming Label Learning (DSLL), to classify instances with newly emerged labels effectively. DSLL can explore and incorporate the knowledge from past labels and historical models to understand and develop emerging new labels. DSLL consists of three components: 1) a streaming label mapping to extract deep relationships between new labels and past labels with a novel label-correlation aware loss; 2) a streaming feature distillation propagating feature-level knowledge from the historical model to a new model; 3) a senior student network to model new labels with the help of knowledge learned from the past. Theoretically, we prove that DSLL admits tight generalization error bounds for new labels in the DNN framework. Experimentally, extensive empirical results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods to handle the continually emerging new labels.}

This paper introduces the software package BoXHED (pronounced `box-head') for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosting. BoXHED 1.0 is a novel tree-based implementation of the generic estimator proposed in Lee et al. (2017), which was designed for handling time-dependent covariates in a fully nonparametric manner. BoXHED is also the first publicly available software implementation for Lee et al. (2017). Applying it to a cardiovascular disease dataset from the Framingham Heart Study reveals novel interaction effects among known risk factors, potentially resolving an open question in clinical literature.

Similarly, a machine learning model could potentially be trained better with a scorer that ``adapts'' to its current learning state and estimates the importance of each training data instance. Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging problem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a given time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the entire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a reinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In DDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training data, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being trained. Specifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should up-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we would finally like to perform well. Without significant computing overhead, DDS delivers strong and consistent improvements over several strong baselines on two very different tasks of machine translation and image classification.}

Here, we combine iterative methods from phase retrieval with image statistics from deep denoisers, via regularization-by-denoising. The resulting methods inherit the advantages of each approach and outperform other noise-robust phase retrieval algorithms. Our work paves the way for hybrid imaging methods that integrate machine-learned constraints in conventional algorithms.}

To address this challenge, we investigate NPs systematically and present a new variant of NP model that we call Doubly Stochastic Variational Neural Process (DSVNP). This model combines the global latent variable and local latent variables for prediction. We evaluate this model in several experiments, and our results demonstrate competitive prediction performance in multi-output regression and uncertainty estimation in classification.}

Recently, an AutoML for loss function search method AM-LFS has been derived, which leverages reinforcement learning to search loss functions during the training process. But its search space is complex and unstable that hindering its superiority. In this paper, we first analyze that the key to enhance the feature discrimination is actually \textbf{how to reduce the softmax probability}. We then design a unified formulation for the current margin-based softmax losses. Accordingly, we define a novel search space and develop a reward-guided search method to automatically obtain the best candidate. Experimental results on a variety of face recognition benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art alternatives.}

In this paper, we show how to combine recent works on static neural network certification tools with robust control theory to certify a neural network policy in a control loop. We give a sufficient condition and an algorithm to ensure that the closed loop state and control constraints are satisfied when the persistent adversarial perturbation is l-infinity norm bounded. Our method is based on finding a positively invariant set of the closed loop dynamical system, and thus we do not require the continuity of the neural network policy. Along with the verification result, we also develop an effective attack strategy for neural network control systems that outperforms exhaustive Monte-Carlo search significantly. We show that our certification algorithm works well on learned models and could achieve 5 times better result than the traditional Lipschitz-based method to certify the robustness of a neural network policy on the cart-pole balance control problem.}

The irregularity of such data violates some key assumptions used in almost all existing DP-SCO and DP-ERM methods, resulting in failure to provide the DP guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework, which has an excess population risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon^4})$ (after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the \emph{expected} excess population risk to $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{ n\epsilon^2 })$. To lift these additional conditions, we also provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based scheme to achieve excess population risks of $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^\frac{2}{3}}{(n\epsilon^2)^\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly convex and general convex loss functions, respectively, \emph{with high probability}. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our algorithms can effectively deal with the challenges caused by data irregularity.}

  abstract =   {Recent papers have demonstrated that ensemble stumps and trees could be vulnerable to small input perturbations, so robustness verification and defense for those models have become an important research problem. However, due to the structure of decision trees, where each node makes decision purely based on one feature value, all the previous works only consider the $\ell_\infty$ norm perturbation. To study robustness with respect to a general $\ell_p$ norm perturbation, one has to consider the correlation between perturbations on different features, which has not been handled by previous algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of robustness verification and certified defense with respect to general $\ell_p$ norm perturbations for ensemble decision stumps and trees. For robustness verification of ensemble stumps, we prove that complete verification is NP-complete for $p\in(0, \infty)$ while polynomial time algorithms exist for $p=0$ or $\infty$. For $p\in(0, \infty)$ we develop an efficient dynamic programming based algorithm for sound verification of ensemble stumps. For ensemble trees, we generalize the previous multi-level robustness verification algorithm to $\ell_p$ norm. We demonstrate the first certified defense method for training ensemble stumps and trees with respect to $\ell_p$ norm perturbations, and verify its effectiveness empirically on real datasets.}

There has been significant recent interest in integrating Bayesian neural networks into Thompson sampling. Most of these methods rely on global variable uncertainty for exploration. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic modeling framework for Thompson sampling, where local latent variable uncertainty is used to sample the mean reward. Variational inference is used to approximate the posterior of the local variable, and semi-implicit structure is further introduced to enhance its expressiveness. Our experimental results on eight contextual bandit benchmark datasets show that Thompson sampling guided by local uncertainty achieves state-of-the-art performance while having low computational complexity.}

In this paper, we focus on the problem of exactly recovering the communities in a binary symmetric SBM, where a graph of $n$ vertices is partitioned into two equal-sized communities and the vertices are connected with probability $p = \alpha\log(n)/n$ within communities and $q = \beta\log(n)/n$ across communities for some $\alpha>\beta>0$. We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm for solving this problem, which employs the power method with a random starting point in the first-stage and turns to a generalized power method that can identify the communities in a finite number of iterations in the second-stage. It is shown that for any fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{\beta} > \sqrt{2}$, which is known to be the information-theoretical limit for exact recovery, the proposed algorithm exactly identifies the underlying communities in $\tilde{O}(n)$ running time with probability tending to one as $n\rightarrow\infty$. We also present numerical results of the proposed algorithm to support and complement our theoretical development.}

We introduce a novel visual analogy benchmark that allows the graded evaluation of extrapolation as a function of distance from the convex domain defined by the training data. We also introduce a simple technique, temporal context normalization, that encourages representations that emphasize the relations between objects. We find that this technique enables a significant improvement in the ability to extrapolate, considerably outperforming a number of competitive techniques.}

Our proposed unsupervised language model is trained over unlabeled corpora.

We further use the semantic relations in the WordNet, by extracting semantic level inter-word connections from each document-sentence pair in the WSD dataset.

Recently, PnP has achieved great empirical success, especially with the integration of deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key problem of PnP based approaches is that they require manual parameter tweaking. It is necessary to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in terms of imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present a tuning-free PnP proximal algorithm, which can automatically determine the internal parameters including the penalty parameter, the denoising strength and the terminal time. A key part of our approach is to develop a policy network for automatic search of parameters, which can be effectively learned via mixed model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize different parameters for different states, and often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss the practical considerations of the plugged denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield state-of-the-art results. This is prevalent on both linear and nonlinear exemplary inverse imaging problems, and in particular, we show promising results on Compressed Sensing MRI and phase retrieval.}

In this paper, two model-free algorithms are introduced for learning infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The first algorithm reduces the problem to the discounted-reward version and achieves $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret after $T$ steps, under the minimal assumption of weakly communicating MDPs. To our knowledge, this is the first model-free algorithm for general MDPs in this setting. The second algorithm makes use of recent advances in adaptive algorithms for adversarial multi-armed bandits and improves the regret to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, albeit with a stronger ergodic assumption. This result significantly improves over the $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret achieved by the only existing model-free algorithm by Abbasi-Yadkori et al.

This work demonstrates that dropout introduces two distinct but entangled regularization effects: an explicit effect (also studied in prior work) which occurs since dropout modifies the expected training objective, and, perhaps surprisingly, an additional implicit effect from the stochasticity in the dropout training update. This implicit regularization effect is analogous to the effect of stochasticity in small mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. We disentangle these two effects through controlled experiments. We then derive analytic simplifications which characterize each effect in terms of the derivatives of the model and the loss, for deep neural networks. We demonstrate these simplified, analytic regularizers accurately capture the important aspects of dropout, showing they faithfully replace dropout in practice.}

When CIs for multiple selected parameters are being reported, the analog of the false discovery rate (FDR) is the false coverage rate (FCR), which is the expected ratio of number of reported CIs failing to cover their respective parameters to the total number of reported CIs. Here, we consider the general problem of FCR control in the online setting, where one encounters an infinite sequence of fixed unknown parameters ordered by time. We propose a novel solution to the problem which only requires the scientist to be able to construct marginal CIs. As special cases, our framework yields algorithms for online FDR control and online sign-classification procedures that control the false sign rate (FSR). All of our methodology applies equally well to prediction intervals, having particular implications for selective conformal inference.}

Classical simulation-based approaches assume access to the underlying process so that trajectories of sufficient length can be gathered to approximate stationary sampling. Instead, we consider an alternative setting where a \emph{fixed} set of transitions has been collected beforehand, by a separate, possibly unknown procedure. The goal is still to estimate properties of the stationary distribution, but without additional access to the underlying system. We propose a consistent estimator that is based on recovering a correction ratio function over the given data. In particular, we develop a variational power method (VPM) that provides provably consistent estimates under general conditions. In addition to unifying a number of existing approaches from different subfields, we also find that VPM yields significantly better estimates across a range of problems, including queueing, stochastic differential equations, post-processing MCMC, and off-policy evaluation.}

  abstract =   {The problem of adversarial examples has shown that modern Neural Network (NN) models could be rather fragile. Among the more established techniques to solve the problem, one is to require the model to be \emph{$\epsilon$-adversarially robust} (AR); that is, to require the model not to change predicted labels when any given input examples are perturbed within a certain range. However, it is observed that such methods would lead to standard performance degradation, i.e., the degradation on natural examples. In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization perspective. We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t. perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard performance. Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that build AR into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.}

Thus, state-of-the-art approaches either abandon the maximum-likelihood framework entirely, or else rely on a variety of variational approximations to the posterior distribution over the latents. Here, we propose an alternative approach that we call amortised learning. Rather than computing an approximation to the posterior over latents, we use a wake-sleep Monte-Carlo strategy to learn a function that directly estimates the maximum-likelihood parameter updates. Amortised learning is possible whenever samples of latents and observations can be simulated from the generative model, treating the model as a ``black box''. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of complex models, including those with latents that are discrete or supported on non-Euclidean spaces.}

However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions when compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a ``cold posterior'' that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of cold posteriors.}

We propose two variations of predictive sampling, namely sampling with ARM fixed-point iteration and learned forecasting modules. Their effectiveness is demonstrated in two settings: i) explicit likelihood modeling on binary MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10, and ii) discrete latent modeling in an autoencoder trained on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Imagenet32.

These problems typically exist as parts of larger frameworks, wherein quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating over posterior distributions. These quantities are frequently intractable, motivating the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this factorization, we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling, which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test competing sampling schemes' statistical properties and practical ramifications, we demonstrate how decoupled sample paths accurately represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.}

This paper shows how to semiparametrically model latent confounders that have this structure and thereby improve estimates of causal effects. The key innovations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaussian processes with structured latent confounders (GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm for this model based on elliptical slice sampling. GP-SLC provides principled Bayesian uncertainty estimates of individual treatment effect with minimal assumptions about the functional forms relating confounders, covariates, treatment, and outcome. Finally, this paper shows GP-SLC is competitive with or more accurate than widely used causal inference techniques on three benchmark datasets, including the Infant Health and Development Program and a dataset showing the effect of changing temperatures on state-wide energy consumption across New England.}

  abstract =   {To accelerate kernel methods, we propose a near input sparsity time method for sampling the high-dimensional space implicitly defined by a kernel transformation. Our main contribution is an importance sampling method for subsampling the feature space of a degree $q$ tensoring of data points in almost input sparsity time, improving the recent oblivious sketching of (Ahle et al., 2020) by a factor of $q^{5/2}/\epsilon^2$. This leads to a subspace embedding for the polynomial kernel as well as the Gaussian kernel with a target dimension that is only linearly dependent on the statistical dimension of the kernel and in time which is only linearly dependent on the sparsity of the input dataset. We show how our subspace embedding bounds imply new statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Furthermore, we empirically show that in large-scale regression tasks, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art kernel approximation methods.}

In order to obtain the best performance, we usually train a model by tuning the regularization parameters. It becomes costly, however, when a single round of training takes significant amount of time. Very recently, Neu and Rosasco show that if we run stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on linear regression problems, then by averaging the SGD iterates properly, we obtain a regularized solution. It left open whether the same phenomenon can be achieved for other optimization problems and algorithms. In this paper, we establish an averaging scheme that provably converts the iterates of SGD on an arbitrary strongly convex and smooth objective function to its regularized counterpart with an adjustable regularization parameter. Our approaches can be used for accelerated and preconditioned optimization methods as well. We further show that the same methods work empirically on more general optimization objectives including neural networks. In sum, we obtain adjustable regularization for free for a large class of optimization problems and resolve an open question raised by Neu and Rosasco.}

While past studies confirm that the magnitude and the covariance structure of gradient noise are critical for regularization, it remains unclear whether or not the class of noise distributions is important. In this work we provide negative results by showing that noises in classes different from the SGD noise can also effectively regularize gradient descent. Our finding is based on a novel observation on the structure of the SGD noise: it is the multiplication of the gradient matrix and a sampling noise that arises from the mini-batch sampling procedure. Moreover, the sampling noises unify two kinds of gradient regularizing noises that belong to the Gaussian class: the one using (scaled) Fisher as covariance and the one using the gradient covariance of SGD as covariance. Finally, thanks to the flexibility of choosing noise class, an algorithm is proposed to perform noisy gradient descent that generalizes well, the variant of which even benefits large batch SGD training without hurting generalization.}

  abstract =   {Deep models, while being extremely flexible and accurate, are surprisingly vulnerable to ``small, imperceptible'' perturbations known as adversarial attacks. While the majority of existing attacks focus on measuring perturbations under the $\ell_p$ metric, Wasserstein distance, which takes geometry in pixel space into account, has long been known to be a suitable metric for measuring image quality and has recently risen as a compelling alternative to the $\ell_p$ metric in adversarial attacks. However, constructing an effective attack under the Wasserstein metric is computationally much more challenging and calls for better optimization algorithms. We address this gap in two ways: (a) we develop an exact yet efficient projection operator to enable a stronger projected gradient attack; (b) we show that the Frank-Wolfe method equipped with a suitable linear minimization oracle works extremely fast under Wasserstein constraints. Our algorithms not only converge faster but also generate much stronger attacks. For instance, we decrease the accuracy of a residual network on CIFAR-10 to $3.4\%$ within a Wasserstein perturbation ball of radius $0.005$, in contrast to $65.6\%$ using the previous Wasserstein attack based on an \emph{approximate} projection operator. Furthermore, employing our stronger attacks in adversarial training significantly improves the robustness of adversarially trained models.}

While various tokenization methods exist, there is no common acknowledgement which is the best. In this work, we propose to leverage the mixed representations from different tokenization methods for sequence generation tasks, in order to boost the model performance with unique characteristics and advantages of individual tokenization methods. Specifically, we introduce a new model architecture to incorporate mixed representations and a co-teaching algorithm to better utilize the diversity of different tokenization methods.

In this paper, we propose improving the adversarial robustness of a network by leveraging the potentially large test data seen at runtime. We devise a new defense method, called runtime masking and cleansing (RMC), that adapts the network at runtime before making a prediction to dynamically mask network gradients and cleanse the model of the non-robust features inevitably learned during the training process due to the size limit of the training set. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RMC empirically.}

First, we show that transformations which preserve the labels of the data can improve estimation by enlarging the span of the training data. Second, we show that transformations which mix data can improve estimation by playing a regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights on MNIST. Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches over the space of transformations by how \emph{uncertain} the model is about the transformed data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For example, our method outperforms RandAugment by 1.24\% on CIFAR-100 using Wide-ResNet-28-10. Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA Adversarial AutoAugment on CIFAR datasets.}

We propose continuous graph neural networks (CGNN), which generalise existing graph neural networks with discrete dynamics in that they can be viewed as a specific discretisation scheme. The key idea is how to characterise the continuous dynamics of node representations, i.e. the derivatives of node representations, w.r.t. time.Inspired by existing diffusion-based methods on graphs (e.g. PageRank and epidemic models on social networks), we define the derivatives as a combination of the current node representations,the representations of neighbors, and the initial values of the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphs{---}including each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change independently or interact with each other{---}both with theoretical justification. The proposed continuous graph neural net-works are robust to over-smoothing and hence allow us to build deeper networks, which in turn are able to capture the long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on the task of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.}

However, the strength of graphical modeling hinges on our ability to encode and estimate conditional dependencies. In particular, commonly used measures such as partial correlation are only meaningful under strongly parametric (in this case, multivariate Gaussian) assumptions. These assumptions are unverifiable, and there is often little reason to believe they hold in practice. In this paper, we instead consider 3 non-parametric measures of conditional dependence. These measures are meaningful without structural assumptions on the multivariate distribution of the data. In addition, we show that for 2 of these measures there are simple, strong plug-in estimators that require only the estimation of a conditional mean. These plug-in estimators (1) are asymptotically linear and non-parametrically efficient, (2) allow incorporation of flexible machine learning techniques for conditional mean estimation, and (3) enable the construction of valid Wald-type confidence intervals. In addition, by leveraging the influence function of these estimators, one can obtain intervals with simultaneous coverage guarantees for all pairs of features.}

In this work, we provide such a characterization in the limit of very wide and very deep networks, for which the analysis simplifies considerably. For wide networks, the trajectory under gradient descent is governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and for deep networks the NTK itself maintains only weak data dependence. By analyzing the spectrum of the NTK, we formulate necessary conditions for trainability and generalization across a range of architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We identify large regions of hyperparameter space for which networks can memorize the training set but completely fail to generalize. We find that CNNs without global average pooling behave almost identically to FCNs, but that CNNs with pooling have markedly different and often better generalization performance. These theoretical results are corroborated experimentally on CIFAR10 for a variety of network architectures.

In this work, we propose a novel architecture called Maximum-and-Concatenation Networks (MCN) to try eliminating bad local minima and improving generalization ability as well. Remarkably, we prove that MCN has a very nice property; that is, every local minimum of an (l+1)-layer MCN can be better than, at least as good as, the global minima of the network consisting of its first l layers. In other words, by increasing the network depth, MCN can autonomously improve its local minima's goodness, what is more, it is easy to plug MCN into an existing deep model to make it also have this property. Finally, under mild conditions, we show that MCN can approximate certain continuous function arbitrarily well with high efficiency; that is, the covering number of MCN is much smaller than most existing DNNs such as deep ReLU. Based on this, we further provide a tight generalization bound to guarantee the inference ability of MCN when dealing with testing samples.}

The key idea is to estimate the descent of the loss value after the candidate gradient is applied, where large descent values indicate that the update results in optimization progress.

In this paper, we provide several mathematical results needed for studying the linear regions of CNNs, and use them to derive the maximal and average numbers of linear regions for one-layer ReLU CNNs. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of linear regions of multi-layer ReLU CNNs.

  abstract =   {The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.}

  abstract =   {The variational autoencoder (VAE) can learn the manifold of natural images on certain datasets, as evidenced by meaningful interpolating or extrapolating in the continuous latent space. However, on discrete data such as text, it is unclear if unsupervised learning can discover similar latent space that allows controllable manipulation. In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, where the decoding network fails to generalize. Both as a validation of the explanation and as a fix to the problem, we propose to constrain the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex, and performs manipulation within this simplex. Our proposed method mitigates the latent vacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning of controllable representations for text. Empirically, our method outperforms unsupervised baselines and strong supervised approaches on text style transfer, and is capable of performing more flexible fine-grained control over text generation than existing methods.}

First, we examine the convergence rates of the expected excess weighted risk of plug-in classifiers where the weighting for the plug-in classifier and the risk may be different. This leads to irreducible errors that do not converge to the weighted Bayes risk, which motivates our consideration of robust risks. We define a robust risk that minimizes risk over a set of weightings, show excess risk bounds for this problem, and demonstrate that particular choices of the weighting set leads to a special instance of conditional value at risk (CVaR) from stochastic programming, which we call label conditional value at risk (LCVaR). Additionally, we generalize this weighting to derive a new robust risk problem that we call label heterogeneous conditional value at risk (LHCVaR). Finally, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of LCVaR and LHCVaR on improving class conditional risks.}

To this end, we present a conceptually novel perspective from control theory to directly model the dynamics of GANs in the frequency domain and provide simple yet effective methods to stabilize GAN's training. We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical Dirac GAN and adopt the widely-used closed-loop control (CLC) to improve its stability. We then extend CLC to stabilize the training dynamic of normal GANs, which can be implemented as an L2 regularizer on the output of the discriminator. Empirical results show that our method can effectively stabilize the training and obtain state-of-the-art performance on data generation tasks.}

This regularization penalizes the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance between the latent prior and its corresponding posterior, which allows us to learn a structured prior distribution associated with the generative model in a flexible way. Moreover, it helps us co-train multiple autoencoders even if they are with heterogeneous architectures and incomparable latent spaces. We implement the framework with two scalable algorithms, making it applicable for both probabilistic and deterministic autoencoders. Our relational regularized autoencoder (RAE) outperforms existing methods, e.g., variational autoencoder, Wasserstein autoencoder, and their variants, on generating images. Additionally, our relational co-training strategy of autoencoders achieves encouraging results in both synthesis and real-world multi-view learning tasks.}

Most existing algorithms solve this problem with a weighted averaging process to aggregate input pixels. However, the weight matrix of this process is often empirically designed and not robust to complex input. In this work, we propose to learn the weight matrix for joint image filtering. This is a challenging problem, as directly learning a large weight matrix is computationally intractable. To address this issue, we introduce the correlation of deep features to approximate the aggregation weights. However, this strategy only uses inner product for the weight matrix estimation, which limits the performance of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, we further propose to learn a nonlinear function to predict sparse residuals of the feature correlation matrix. Note that the proposed method essentially factorizes the weight matrix into a low-rank and a sparse matrix and then learn both of them simultaneously with deep neural networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide variety of joint filtering tasks.}

To solve this problem, we consider the label distributions as the latent vectors and infer them from the logical labels in the training datasets by using variational inference. After that, we induce a predictive model to train the label distribution data by employing the multi-output regression technique. The recovery experiment on thirteen real-world LDL datasets and the predictive experiment on ten multi-label learning datasets validate the advantage of our approach over the state-of-the-art approaches.}

In this work, we propose an efficient evolutionary learning algorithm to find the Pareto set approximation for continuous robot control problems, by extending a state-of-the-art RL algorithm and presenting a novel prediction model to guide the learning process. In addition to efficiently discovering the individual policies on the Pareto front, we construct a continuous set of Pareto-optimal solutions by Pareto analysis and interpolation. Furthermore, we design seven multi-objective RL environments with continuous action space, which is the first benchmark platform to evaluate MORL algorithms on various robot control problems. We test the previous methods on the proposed benchmark problems, and the experiments show that our approach is able to find a much denser and higher-quality set of Pareto policies than the existing algorithms.}

By further incorporating a novel optimization scheme into the training procedure, plausible predictions can be sampled efficiently from distribution constructed from the retrieved examples. Meanwhile, our method could be seamlessly integrated with existing stochastic predictive models; significant enhancement is observed with comprehensive experiments in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

However, PDE-CO is often computationally prohibitive due to the need to solve the PDE---typically via finite element analysis (FEA)---at each step of the optimization procedure. In this paper we propose amortized finite element analysis (AmorFEA), in which a neural network learns to produce accurate PDE solutions, while preserving many of the advantages of traditional finite element methods. This network is trained to directly minimize the potential energy from which the PDE and finite element method are derived, avoiding the need to generate costly supervised training data by solving PDEs with traditional FEA. As FEA is a variational procedure, AmorFEA is a direct analogue to popular amortized inference approaches in latent variable models, with the finite element basis acting as the variational family. AmorFEA can perform PDE-CO without the need to repeatedly solve the associated PDE, accelerating optimization when compared to a traditional workflow using FEA and the adjoint method.}

Our $\ell_0$-based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution; such relaxation allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli distributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justification for incorporating Bernoulli distribution into feature selection. Furthermore, we evaluate our method using synthetic and real-life data to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used methods in both predictive performance and feature selection.}

Our algorithm can be seen as a novel extension of arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, and uses adaptive quantization accuracy based on estimates of posterior uncertainty. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single standard VAE.

Many works have devised new randomized smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however, substantial effort was needed to derive such new guarantees. This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing? We propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our theoretical contributions are: (1) we show that for an appropriate notion of "optimal", the optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norms have level sets given by the norm's *Wulff Crystal*; (2) we propose two novel and complementary methods for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution; and, (3) we show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. Meanwhile, we show using (3) that with only label statistics under random input perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_p$-norm $\Omega(\min(1, d^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}))$, when the input dimension $d$ is large.

  abstract =   {Recently, deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a highly active research area as many real-world problems can be inherently viewed as multiagent systems. A particularly interesting and widely applicable class of problems is the partially observable cooperative multiagent setting, in which a team of agents learns to coordinate their behaviors conditioning on their private observations and commonly shared global reward signals. One natural solution is to resort to the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm and during centralized training, one key challenge is the multiagent credit assignment: how to allocate the global rewards for individual agent policies for better coordination towards maximizing system-level's benefits. In this paper, we propose a new method called Q-value Path Decomposition (QPD) to decompose the system's global Q-values into individual agents' Q-values. Unlike previous works which restrict the representation relation of the individual Q-values and the global one, we leverage the integrated gradient attribution technique into deep MARL to directly decompose global Q-values along trajectory paths to assign credits for agents. We evaluate QPD on the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and show that QPD achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent scenarios compared with existing cooperative MARL algorithms.}

Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10\% in absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach is useful in other domains as well, such as program synthesis.}

Then, we define top-$k$ calibration and show it is necessary and sufficient for consistency. Based on the top-$k$ calibration analysis, we propose a rich class of top-$k$ calibrated Bregman divergence surrogates. Our analysis continues by showing previously proposed hinge-like top-$k$ surrogate losses are not top-$k$ calibrated and thus inconsistent. On the other hand, we propose two new hinge-like losses, one which is similarly inconsistent, and one which is consistent. Our empirical results highlight theoretical claims, confirming our analysis of the consistency of these losses.}

  abstract =   {Although ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide insights for designing network architectures, its relationship with the non-residual convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is still unclear. In this paper, we present a novel ODE model by adding a damping term. It can be shown that the proposed model can recover both a ResNet and a CNN by adjusting an interpolation coefficient. Therefore, the damped ODE model provides a unified framework for the interpretation of residual and non-residual networks. The Lyapunov analysis reveals better stability of the proposed model, and thus yields robustness improvement of the learned networks. Experiments on a number of image classification benchmarks show that the proposed model substantially improves the accuracy of ResNet and ResNeXt over the perturbed inputs from both stochastic noise and adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the loss landscape analysis demonstrates the improved robustness of our method along the attack direction.}

A common practice is to parameterize the high-dimensional value and policy functions using given features. However existing methods either have no theoretical guarantee or suffer a regret that is exponential in the planning horizon $H$.In this paper, we propose an online RL algorithm, namely the MatrixRL, that leverages ideas from linear bandit to learn a low-dimensional representation of the probability transition model while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff. We show that MatrixRL achieves a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2d\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $d$ is the number of features, independent with the number of state-action pairs. MatrixRL has an equivalent kernelized version, which is able to work with an arbitrary kernel Hilbert space without using explicit features. In this case, the kernelized MatrixRL satisfies a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2\wt{d}\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$, where $\wt{d}$ is the effective dimension of the kernel space.}

Though practical, current methods rely on restrictive assumptions to decompose the centralized value function across agents for execution. In this paper, we eliminate this restriction by proposing multi-agent determinantal Q-learning. Our method is established on Q-DPP, a novel extension of determinantal point process (DPP) to multi-agent setting. Q-DPP promotes agents to acquire diverse behavioral models; this allows a natural factorization of the joint Q-functions with no need for \emph{a priori} structural constraints on the value function or special network architectures. We demonstrate that Q-DPP generalizes major solutions including VDN, QMIX, and QTRAN on decentralizable cooperative tasks. To efficiently draw samples from Q-DPP, we develop a linear-time sampler with theoretical approximation guarantee. Our sampler also benefits exploration by coordinating agents to cover orthogonal directions in the state space during training. We evaluate our algorithm on multiple cooperative benchmarks; its effectiveness has been demonstrated when compared with the state-of-the-art.}

Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation of this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is \emph{monotonically decreasing} as in the classical theory, the variance is \emph{unimodal} or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent in the recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.}

Unlike most existing transfer learning methods that focus on fixing the discrepancy between supervised tasks, we study how to transfer knowledge from a zoo of unsupervisedly learned models towards another predictive network. Our motivation is that models from different sources are expected to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from different perspectives, thereby effectively supplementing the new task, even if the task has sufficient training samples. Technically, we propose a differentiable framework named transferable memory. It adaptively distills knowledge from a bank of memory states of multiple pretrained RNNs, and applies it to the target network via a novel recurrent structure called the Transferable Memory Unit (TMU). Compared with finetuning, our approach yields significant improvements on three benchmarks for spatiotemporal prediction, and benefits the target task even from less relevant pretext ones.}

Specifically, we design a domain-specific search space based on general patterns of the memorization effect and propose a novel Newton algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, which ensures a good approximation to critical points. Experiments are performed on both benchmark and real-world data sets.

Program repair is challenging for two reasons: First, it requires reasoning and tracking symbols across source code and diagnostic feedback. Second, labeled datasets available for program repair are relatively small. In this work, we propose novel solutions to these two challenges. First, we introduce a program-feedback graph, which connects symbols relevant to program repair in source code and diagnostic feedback, and then apply a graph neural network on top to model the reasoning process. Second, we present a self-supervised learning paradigm for program repair that leverages unlabeled programs available online to create a large amount of extra program repair examples, which we use to pre-train our models. We evaluate our proposed approach on two applications: correcting introductory programming assignments (DeepFix dataset) and correcting the outputs of program synthesis (SPoC dataset). Our final system, DrRepair, significantly outperforms prior work, achieving 68.2\% full repair rate on DeepFix (+22.9\% over the prior best), and 48.4\% synthesis success rate on SPoC (+3.7\% over the prior best).}

However, most existing methods of network pruning are empirical and heuristic, leaving it open whether good subnetworks provably exist, how to find them efficiently, and if network pruning can be provably better than direct training using gradient descent. We answer these problems positively by proposing a simple greedy selection approach for finding good subnetworks, which starts from an empty network and greedily adds important neurons from the large network. This differs from the existing methods based on backward elimination, which remove redundant neurons from the large network. Theoretically, applying the greedy selection strategy on sufficiently large {pre-trained} networks guarantees to find small subnetworks with lower loss than networks directly trained with gradient descent. Our results also apply to pruning randomly weighted networks. Practically, we improve prior arts of network pruning on learning compact neural architectures on ImageNet, including ResNet, MobilenetV2/V3, and ProxylessNet. Our theory and empirical results on MobileNet suggest that we should fine-tune the pruned subnetworks to leverage the information from the large model, instead of re-training from new random initialization as suggested in \citet{liu2018rethinking}.}

We empirically explore a case study, Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation techniques generate biased data-sets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model accuracy.

DVRL uses a data value estimator (DVE) to learn how likely each datum is used in training of the predictor model. DVE is trained using a reinforcement signal that reflects performance on the target task. We demonstrate that DVRL yields superior data value estimates compared to alternative methods across numerous datasets and application scenarios. The corrupted sample discovery performance of DVRL is close to optimal in many regimes (i.e. as if the noisy samples were known apriori), and for domain adaptation and robust learning DVRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by 14.6\% and 10.8\%, respectively.}

The method utilizes a backbone network pretrained on a set of base categories while also employing additional modules that are meta-trained across episodes. Given a new task, the novel feature extracted from the meta-trained modules is mixed with the base feature obtained from the pretrained model. The process of combining two different features provides TAR and is also controlled by meta-trained modules. The TAR contains effective information for classifying both novel and base categories. The base and novel classifiers quickly adapt to a given task by utilizing the TAR. Experiments on standard image datasets indicate that XtarNet achieves state-of-the-art incremental few-shot learning performance. The concept of TAR can also be used in conjunction with existing incremental few-shot learning methods; extensive simulation results in fact show that applying TAR enhances the known methods significantly.}

In this paper, using a recently proposed meta-transfer learning model, Sequential Neural Processes (SNP), we first empirically show that it suffers from a similar underfitting problem observed in the functions inferred by Neural Processes. However, we further demonstrate that unlike the meta-learning setting, the standard attention mechanisms are not effective in meta-transfer setting. To resolve, we propose a new attention mechanism, Recurrent Memory Reconstruction (RMR), and demonstrate that providing an imaginary context that is recurrently updated and reconstructed with interaction is crucial in achieving effective attention for meta-transfer learning.

Using this representation we show that: (1) a ``sweet spot'' of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

The key idea is to track a structured posterior distribution of model parameters, either exactly or approximately. To act, we sample model parameters from their posterior and then use the structure of the influence diagram to find the most optimistic action under the sampled parameters.

State-of-the-art domain adaptation methods make use of deep networks to extract domain-invariant representations. However, existing methods assume that all the instances in the source domain are correctly labeled; while in reality, it is unsurprising that we may obtain a source domain with noisy labels. In this paper, we are the first to comprehensively investigate how label noise could adversely affect existing domain adaptation methods in various scenarios. Further, we theoretically prove that there exists a method that can essentially reduce the side-effect of noisy source labels in domain adaptation. Specifically, focusing on the generalized target shift scenario, where both label distribution $P_Y$ and the class-conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ can change, we discover that the denoising Conditional Invariant Component (DCIC) framework can provably ensures (1) extracting invariant representations given examples with noisy labels in the source domain and unlabeled examples in the target domain and (2) estimating the label distribution in the target domain with no bias. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel reward learning module to generate intrinsic reward signals via a generative model. Our generative method can perform better forward state transition and backward action encoding, which improves the module's dynamics modeling ability in the environment. Thus, our module provides the imitation agent both the intrinsic intention of the demonstrator and a better exploration ability, which is critical for the agent to outperform the demonstrator. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art IRL methods on multiple Atari games, even with one-life demonstration. Remarkably, our method achieves performance that is up to 5 times the performance of the demonstration.}

  abstract =   {\textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}onvolutional \textbf{N}etwork (\textbf{GCN}) is widely used in graph data learning tasks such as recommendation. However, when facing a large graph, the graph convolution is very computationally expensive thus is simplified in all existing GCNs, yet is seriously impaired due to the oversimplification. To address this gap, we leverage the \emph{original graph convolution} in GCN and propose a \textbf{L}ow-pass \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{F}ilter (\textbf{LCF}) to make it applicable to the large graph. LCF is designed to remove the noise caused by exposure and quantization in the observed data, and it also reduces the complexity of graph convolution in an unscathed way. Experiments show that LCF improves the effectiveness and efficiency of graph convolution and our GCN outperforms existing GCNs significantly.

  abstract =   {We consider learning a multi-class classification model in the federated setting, where each user has access to the positive data associated with only a single class. As a result, during each federated learning round, the users need to locally update the classifier without having access to the features and the model parameters for the negative classes. Thus, naively employing conventional decentralized learning such as distributed SGD or Federated Averaging may lead to trivial or extremely poor classifiers. In particular, for embedding based classifiers, all the class embeddings might collapse to a single point. To address this problem, we propose a generic framework for training with only positive labels, namely Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS), where the server imposes a geometric regularizer after each round to encourage classes to be spreadout in the embedding space. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that FedAwS can almost match the performance of conventional learning where users have access to negative labels. We further extend the proposed method to settings with large output spaces.}

In this paper, we propose a general variational framework termed f-EBM to train EBMs using any desired f-divergence. We introduce a corresponding optimization algorithm and prove its local convergence property with non-linear dynamical systems theory. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of f-EBM over contrastive divergence, as well as the benefits of training EBMs using f-divergences other than KL.}

In addition to being an explicit embedding method, it also allows us to efficiently and effectively approximate graph metric distances (as well as complete kernel functions); a criterion to select the embedding dimension trading off the approximation accuracy with the computational cost is also provided. GRNF can be used within traditional processing methods or as a training-free input layer of a graph neural network. The theoretical guarantees that accompany GRNF ensure that the considered graph distance is metric, hence allowing to distinguish any pair of non-isomorphic graphs.}

First we relate this condition to other common frameworks and show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP assumption of prior work. Second we provide an algorithm with a high probability regret bound $\widetilde O(\sum_{t=1}^H d_t \sqrt{K} + \sum_{t=1}^H \sqrt{d_t} \IBE K)$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, $\IBE$ is the value if the inherent Bellman error and $d_t$ is the feature dimension at timestep $t$. In addition, we show that the result is unimprovable beyond constants and logs by showing a matching lower bound. This has two important consequences: 1) it shows that exploration is possible using only \emph{batch assumptions} with an algorithm that achieves the optimal statistical rate for the setting we consider, which is more general than prior work on low-rank MDPs 2) the lack of closedness (measured by the inherent Bellman error) is only amplified by $\sqrt{d_t}$ despite working in the online setting. Finally, the algorithm reduces to the celebrated \textsc{LinUCB} when $H=1$ but with a different choice of the exploration parameter that allows handling misspecified contextual linear bandits. While computational tractability questions remain open for the MDP setting, this enriches the class of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function where statistically efficient reinforcement learning is possible.}

Yet, existing WMI solvers are not ready to scale to these problems. They either ignore the intrinsic dependency structure of the problem entirely, or they are limited to overly restrictive structures. To narrow this gap, we derive a factorized WMI computation enabling us to devise a scalable WMI solver based on message passing, called MP-WMI. Namely, MP-WMI is the first WMI solver that can (i) perform exact inference on the full class of tree-structured WMI problems, and (ii) perform inter-query amortization, e.g., to compute all marginal densities simultaneously. Experimental results show that our solver dramatically outperforms the existingWMI solvers on a large set of benchmarks.}

We leverage programmatic labeling functions to specify controllable styles, and derive a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective, which can then be solved using conventional policy learning approaches. We evaluate our framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that existing approaches that do not explicitly enforce style-consistency fail to generate diverse behaviors whereas our learned policies can be calibrated for up to $4^5 (1024)$ distinct style combinations.}

These regimes are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of the critical ingredients underlying more personalized decision-making systems. All reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal DTR in online settings will suffer O(\sqrt{|D_{X, S}|T}) regret on some environments, where T is the number of experiments, and D_{X, S} is the domains of treatments X and covariates S. This implies T = O (|D_{X, S}|) trials to generate an optimal DTR. In many applications, domains of X and S could be so enormous that the time required to ensure appropriate learning may be unattainable. We show that, if the causal diagram of the underlying environment is provided, one could achieve regret that is exponentially smaller than D_{X, S}. In particular, we develop two online algorithms that satisfy such regret bounds by exploiting the causal structure underlying the DTR; one is based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU-DTR), and the other uses the posterior sampling learning (PS-DTR). Finally, we introduce efficient methods to accelerate these online learning procedures by leveraging the abundant, yet biased observational (non-experimental) data.}

Our approach combines the advantages of search-based techniques for adversarial training with abstraction-based techniques. Specifically, we show how to decompose a set of user-defined string transformations into two component specifications, one that benefits from search and another from abstraction. We use our technique to train models on the AG and SST2 datasets and show that the resulting models are robust to combinations of user-defined transformations mimicking spelling mistakes and other meaning-preserving transformations.}

This paper focuses on computing Team-Maxmin Equilibria (TMEs), which is an important solution concept for zero-sum multiplayer games where players in a team having the same utility function play against an adversary independently. Existing algorithms are inefficient to compute TMEs in large games, especially when the strategy space is too large to be represented due to limited memory. In two-player games, the Incremental Strategy Generation (ISG) algorithm is an efficient approach to avoid enumerating all pure strategies. However, the study of ISG for computing TMEs is completely unexplored. To fill this gap, we first study the properties of ISG for multiplayer games, showing that ISG converges to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) but may not converge to a TME. Second, we design an ISG variant for TMEs (ISGT) by exploiting that a TME is an NE maximizing the team's utility and show that ISGT converges to a TME and the impossibility of relaxing conditions in ISGT. Third, to further improve the scalability, we design an ISGT variant (CISGT) by using the strategy space for computing an equilibrium that is close to a TME but is easier to be computed as the initial strategy space of ISGT. Finally, extensive experimental results show that CISGT is orders of magnitude faster than ISGT and the state-of-the-art algorithm to compute TMEs in large games.}

The major difﬁculty comes from the nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization structure. To bridge the gap between practice and theory, we analyze a gradient-based algorithm with alternating updates and establish its sublinear convergence to the globally optimal solution.

To overcome this difficulty, we propose a "safety-critical adaptation" task setting: an agent first trains in non-safety-critical "source" environments such as in a simulator, before it adapts to the target environment where failures carry heavy costs. We propose a solution approach, CARL, that builds on the intuition that prior experience in diverse environments equips an agent to estimate risk, which in turn enables relative safety through risk-averse, cautious adaptation. CARL first employs model-based RL to train a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty about transition dynamics and catastrophic states across varied source environments. Then, when exploring a new safety-critical environment with unknown dynamics, the CARL agent plans to avoid actions that could lead to catastrophic states. In experiments on car driving, cartpole balancing, and half-cheetah locomotion, CARL successfully acquires cautious exploration behaviors, yielding higher rewards with fewer failures than strong RL adaptation baselines.}

We settle the query complexity for the active-learning (preference elicitation) version, where the learner chooses the prices to post, by giving a \emph{biased binary search} algorithm, generalizing the classical binary search procedure. We complement our query complexity upper bounds by lower bounds that match up to lower-order terms. We also study the passive-learning version in which the learner does not control the prices, and instead they are sampled from some distribution.

Our decoders works sequentially, where at each step a child node and its parent node are simultaneously generated to form a sub-tree. This sub-tree is consequently used to construct the final tree structure in a recurrent manner. Key to the success of our tree decoder is twofold, (i) it strictly respects the parent-child relationship of trees, and (ii) it explicitly outputs trees as oppose to a linear string. Evaluated on both math formula recognition and chemical formula recognition, the proposed tree decoder is shown to greatly outperform strong string decoder baselines.}

Quantitatively, we wish to maximize the standard \emph{hypervolume indicator} metric, which measures the dominated hypervolume of the entire set of chosen inputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel scalarization function, which we term the \emph{hypervolume scalarization}, and show that drawing random scalarizations from an appropriately chosen distribution can be used to efficiently approximate the \emph{hypervolume indicator} metric. We utilize this connection to show that Bayesian optimization with our scalarization via common acquisition functions, such as Thompson Sampling or Upper Confidence Bound, provably converges to the whole Pareto frontier by deriving tight \emph{hypervolume regret} bounds on the order of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, we highlight the general utility of our scalarization framework by showing that any provably convergent single-objective optimization process can be converted to a multi-objective optimization process with provable convergence guarantees.}

We show that none of the existing methods satisfy all three requirements, and demonstrate how Mix-n-Match calibration strategies (i.e., ensemble and composition) can help achieve remarkably better data-efficiency and expressive power while provably maintaining the classification accuracy of the original classifier. Mix-n-Match strategies are generic in the sense that they can be used to improve the performance of any off-the-shelf calibrator. We also reveal potential issues in standard evaluation practices. Popular approaches (e.g., histogram-based expected calibration error (ECE)) may provide misleading results especially in small-data regime. Therefore, we propose an alternative data-efficient kernel density-based estimator for a reliable evaluation of the calibration performance and prove its asymptotically unbiasedness and consistency. Our approaches outperform state-of-the-art solutions on both the calibration as well as the evaluation tasks in most of the experimental settings.

In particular, only structure learning under approximate differential privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic dependence on the dimensionality of the data, while a change in either the learning goal or the privacy notion would necessitate a polynomial dependence. As a result, we show that the privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning problems in the high-dimensional data regime.}

In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning generative models with various underlying structures in the latent space. Learning controllable and generalizable representation of multivariate data with desired structural properties remains a fundamental problem in machine learning. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning generative models with various underlying structures in the latent space. We represent the inductive bias in the form of mask variables to model the dependency structure in the graphical model and extend the theory of multivariate information bottleneck (Friedman et al., 2001) to enforce it. Our model provides a principled approach to learn a set of semantically meaningful latent factors that reflect various types of desired structures like capturing correlation or encoding invariance, while also offering the flexibility to automatically estimate the dependency structure from data. We show that our framework unifies many existing generative models and can be applied to a variety of tasks, including multimodal data modeling, algorithmic fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization.}

However, the computation of unlabeled linear regression proves to be cumbersome and existing algorithms typically require considerable time, especially in the high dimensional regime. In this paper, we propose a one-step estimator which is optimal from both the computational and the statistical aspects. From the computational perspective, our estimator exhibits the same order of computational complexity as that of the oracle case (which means the regression coefficients are known in advance and only the permutation needs recovery). From the statistical perspective, when comparing with the necessary conditions for permutation recovery, our requirement on the \emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\mathsf{SNR}$) agrees up to merely $\Omega\left(\log \log n\right)$ difference when the stable rank of the regression coefficients $\ensuremath{\mathbf{B}}^{\natural}$ is much less than $\log n/\log \log n$. }

  abstract =   {We study the problem of constructing black-box adversarial attacks, where no model information is revealed except for the feedback knowledge of the given inputs. To obtain sufficient knowledge for crafting adversarial examples, previous methods query the target model with inputs that are perturbed with different searching directions. However, these methods suffer from poor query efficiency since the employed searching directions are sampled randomly. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the goal of mounting efficient attacks as an optimization problem in which the adversary tries to fool the target model with a limited number of queries. Under such settings, the adversary has to select appropriate searching directions to reduce the number of model queries. By solving the efficient-attack problem, we find that we need to distill the knowledge in both the path of the adversarial examples and the path of the searching directions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, dual-path distillation, that utilizes the feedback knowledge not only to craft adversarial examples but also to alter the searching directions to achieve efficient attacks. Experimental results suggest that our framework can significantly increase the query efficiency.}

This class contains important examples such as ReLU neural networks and others with non-differentiable activation functions. First, we show that finding an epsilon-stationary point with first-order methods is impossible in finite time. Therefore, we introduce the notion of (delta, epsilon)-stationarity, a generalization that allows for a point to be within distance delta of an epsilon-stationary point and reduces to epsilon-stationarity for smooth functions. We propose a series of randomized first-order methods and analyze their complexity of finding a (delta, epsilon)-stationary point. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound and show that our stochastic algorithm has min-max optimal dependence on delta. Empirically, our methods perform well for training ReLU neural networks.}

To enhance their capacity, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been incorporated due to RNNs' successes in processing sequential data such as languages. Recent evidence suggests that self-attention is more competent than RNNs in dealing with languages. However, we are unaware of the effectiveness of self-attention in the context of Hawkes processes. This study aims to fill the gap by designing a self-attentive Hawkes process (SAHP). SAHP employs self-attention to summarise the influence of history events and compute the probability of the next event. One deficit of the conventional self-attention when applied to event sequences is that its positional encoding only considers the order of a sequence ignoring the time intervals between events. To overcome this deficit, we modify its encoding by translating time intervals into phase shifts of sinusoidal functions. Experiments on goodness-of-fit and prediction tasks show the improved capability of SAHP. Furthermore, SAHP is more interpretable than RNN-based counterparts because the learnt attention weights reveal contributions of one event type to the happening of another type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the effectiveness of self-attention in Hawkes processes.}

GradientDICE fixes several problems of GenDICE (Zhang et al., 2020), the current state-of-the-art for estimating such density ratios. Namely, the optimization problem in GenDICE is not a convex-concave saddle-point problem once nonlinearity in optimization variable parameterization is introduced to ensure positivity, so primal-dual algorithms are not guaranteed to find the desired solution. However, such nonlinearity is essential to ensure the consistency of GenDICE even with a tabular representation. This is a fundamental contradiction, resulting from GenDICE's original formulation of the optimization problem. In GradientDICE, we optimize a different objective from GenDICE by using the Perron-Frobenius theorem and eliminating GenDICE's use of divergence, such that nonlinearity in parameterization is not necessary for GradientDICE, which is provably convergent under linear function approximation.}

We categorize such attacks by the infinity-norm constraint on $\delta_t$: We provide a lower threshold below which reward-poisoning attack is infeasible and RL is certified to be safe; we provide a corresponding upper threshold above which the attack is feasible. Feasible attacks can be further categorized as non-adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends only on $(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1})$, or adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends further on the RL agent's learning process at time $t$. Non-adaptive attacks have been the focus of prior works. However, we show that under mild conditions, adaptive attacks can achieve the nefarious policy in steps polynomial in state-space size $|S|$, whereas non-adaptive attacks require exponential steps. We provide a constructive proof that a Fast Adaptive Attack strategy achieves the polynomial rate. Finally, we show that empirically an attacker can find effective reward-poisoning attacks using state-of-the-art deep RL techniques.}

To address these weaknesses, we propose CAUSE (Causality from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework for the studied task. The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the underlying event interdependency by fitting a neural point process, and then extract from the process a Granger causality statistic using an axiomatic attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled with diverse event interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior performance on correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range of state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract =   {The F-measure is a widely used performance measure for multi-label classification, where multiple labels can be active in an instance simultaneously (e.g. in image tagging, multiple tags can be active in any image). In particular, the F-measure explicitly balances recall (fraction of active labels predicted to be active) and precision (fraction of labels predicted to be active that are actually so), both of which are important in evaluating the overall performance of a multi-label classifier. As with most discrete prediction problems, however, directly optimizing the F-measure is computationally hard. In this paper, we explore the question of designing convex surrogate losses that are calibrated for the F-measure -- specifically, that have the property that minimizing the surrogate loss yields (in the limit of sufficient data) a Bayes optimal multi-label classifier for the F-measure. We show that the F-measure for an $s$-label problem, when viewed as a $2^s \times 2^s$ loss matrix, has rank at most $s^2+1$, and apply a result of Ramaswamy et al. (2014) to design a family of convex calibrated surrogates for the F-measure. The resulting surrogate risk minimization algorithms can be viewed as decomposing the multi-label F-measure learning problem into $s^2+1$ binary class probability estimation problems. We also provide a quantitative regret transfer bound for our surrogates, which allows any regret guarantees for the binary problems to be transferred to regret guarantees for the overall F-measure problem, and discuss a connection with the algorithm of Dembczynski et al. (2013). Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings.}

The fastest algorithms for the problem are new forms of counterfactual regret minimization (Brown & Sandholm, 2019). In this paper we present a totally different approach to the problem, which is competitive and often orders of magnitude better than the prior state of the art. The equilibrium-finding problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) (Koller et al., 1994), but solving it as an LP has not been scalable due to the memory requirements of LP solvers, which can often be quadratically worse than CFR-based algorithms. We give an efficient practical algorithm that factors a large payoff matrix into a product of two matrices that are typically dramatically sparser. This allows us to express the equilibrium-finding problem as a linear program with size only a logarithmic factor worse than CFR, and thus allows linear program solvers to run on such games. With experiments on poker endgames, we demonstrate in practice, for the first time, that modern linear program solvers are competitive against even game-specific modern variants of CFR in solving large extensive-form games, and can be used to compute exact solutions unlike iterative algorithms like CFR.}

In this paper, we provide a theoretically-grounded generalizability analysis of GNNs with one hidden layer for both regression and binary classification problems. Under the assumption that there exists a ground-truth GNN model (with zero generalization error), the objective of GNN learning is to estimate the ground-truth GNN parameters from the training data. To achieve this objective, we propose a learning algorithm that is built on tensor initialization and accelerated gradient descent. We then show that the proposed learning algorithm converges to the ground-truth GNN model for the regression problem, and to a model sufficiently close to the ground-truth for the binary classification problem. Moreover, for both cases, the convergence rate of the proposed learning algorithm is proven to be linear and faster than the vanilla gradient descent algorithm. We further explore the relationship between the sample complexity of GNNs and their underlying graph properties. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm for GNNs.}

However, it is conservative or even pessimistic so that it sometimes hurts the natural generalization. In this paper, we raise a fundamental question{---}do we have to trade off natural generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We propose a novel formulation of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least adversarial data (i.e., friendly adversarial data) minimizing the loss, among the adversarial data that are confidently misclassified. Our novel formulation is easy to implement by just stopping the most adversarial data searching algorithms such as PGD (projected gradient descent) early, which we call early-stopped PGD. Theoretically, FAT is justified by an upper bound of the adversarial risk. Empirically, early-stopped PGD allows us to answer the earlier question negatively{---}adversarial robustness can indeed be achieved without compromising the natural generalization.}

Multilayer networks among the same set of nodes usually share common structures, while each layer can possess its distinct node connecting behaviors. This paper proposes a flexible latent space model for multilayer networks for the purpose of capturing such characteristics. Specifically, the proposed model embeds each node with a latent vector shared among layers and a layer-specific effect for each layer; both elements together with a layer-specific connectivity matrix determine edge formations. To fit the model, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. We also establish theoretical properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and show that the upper bound of the common latent structure's estimation error is inversely proportional to the number of layers under mild conditions. The superior performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through simulation studies and applications to two real-world data examples.}

We argue that this discrepancy may contribute to the difficulties in training generative models. We therefore propose to map both the generated and target distributions to the latent space using the encoder of a standard autoencoder, and train the generator (or decoder) to match the target distribution in the latent space. Specifically, we enforce the consistency in both the data space and the latent space with theoretically justified data and latent reconstruction losses. The resulting generative model, which we call a perceptual generative autoencoder (PGA), is then trained with a maximum likelihood or variational autoencoder (VAE) objective. With maximum likelihood, PGAs generalize the idea of reversible generative models to unrestricted neural network architectures and arbitrary number of latent dimensions. When combined with VAEs, PGAs substantially improve over the baseline VAEs in terms of sample quality. Compared to other autoencoder-based generative models using simple priors, PGAs achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR-10 and CelebA.}

With a rigorous non-asymptotic convergence theory developed, SPOS can avoid the particle-collapsing pitfall of SVGD. However, the variance-reduction effect in SPOS has not been clear. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting several variance-reduction techniques for SPOS. Specifically, we propose three variants of variance-reduced SPOS, called SAGA particle-optimization sampling (SAGA-POS), SVRG particle-optimization sampling (SVRG-POS) and a variant of SVRG-POS which avoids full gradient computations, denoted as SVRG-POS$^+$. Importantly, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for these algorithms in terms of the 2-Wasserstein metric and analyze their complexities. The results show our algorithms yield better convergence rates than existing variance-reduced variants of stochastic Langevin dynamics, though more space is required to store the particles in training. Our theory aligns well with experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.}

For instance, in the environmental monitoring task, features can be dynamically vanished or augmented due to the existence of expired old sensors and deployed new sensors. Furthermore, besides the evolvable feature space, the data distribution is usually changing in the streaming scenario. When both feature space and data distribution are evolvable, it is quite challenging to design algorithms with guarantees, particularly theoretical understandings of generalization ability. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel discrepancy measure for data with evolving feature space and data distribution, named the \emph{evolving discrepancy}. Based on that, we present the generalization error analysis, and the theory motivates the design of a learning algorithm which is further implemented by deep neural networks. Empirical studies on synthetic data verify the rationale of our proposed discrepancy measure, and extensive experiments on real-world tasks validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.}

  abstract =   {Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets.}

  abstract =   {Recent work has shown generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate highly realistic images, that are often indistinguishable (by humans) from real images. Most images so generated are not contained in the training dataset, suggesting potential for augmenting training sets with GAN-generated data. While this scenario is of particular relevance when there are limited data available, there is still the issue of training the GAN itself based on that limited data. To facilitate this, we leverage existing GAN models pretrained on large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) to introduce additional knowledge (which may not exist within the limited data), following the concept of transfer learning. Demonstrated by natural-image generation, we reveal that low-level filters (those close to observations) of both the generator and discriminator of pretrained GANs can be transferred to facilitate generation in a perceptually-distinct target domain with limited training data. To further adapt the transferred filters to the target domain, we propose adaptive filter modulation (AdaFM). An extensive set of experiments is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on generation with limited data.}

  abstract =   {The goal of universal machine translation is to learn to translate between any pair of languages. Despite impressive empirical results and an increasing interest in massively multilingual models, theoretical analysis on translation errors made by such universal machine translation models is only nascent. In this paper, we formally prove certain impossibilities of this endeavour in general, as well as prove positive results in the presence of additional (but natural) structure of data. For the former, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the many-to-many translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to learn shared sentence representations among multiple language pairs has to make a large translation error on at least one of the translation tasks, if no assumption on the structure of the languages is made. For the latter, we show that if the paired documents in the corpus follow a natural \emph{encoder-decoder} generative process, we can expect a natural notion of ``generalization'': a linear number of language pairs, rather than quadratic, suffices to learn a good representation. Our theory also explains what kinds of connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with longer paths result in worse sample complexity. We believe our theoretical insights and implications contribute to the future algorithmic design of universal machine translation.}

A new definition for long memory networks is further introduced, and it requires the model weights to decay at a polynomial rate. To verify our theory, we convert RNN and LSTM into long memory networks by making a minimal modification, and their superiority is illustrated in modeling long-term dependence of various datasets.}

We identify that instability issues stem from difficulties of performing feature matching with mini-batch statistics, due to a fragile balance between the fixed target distribution and the progressively generated distribution. In this work, we propose feature quantizatoin (FQ) for the discriminator, to embed both true and fake data samples into a shared discrete space. The quantized values of FQ are constructed as an evolving dictionary, which is consistent with feature statistics of the recent distribution history. Hence, FQ implicitly enables robust feature matching in a compact space. Our method can be easily plugged into existing GAN models, with little computational overhead in training. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed FQ-GAN can improve the FID scores of baseline methods by a large margin on a variety of tasks, including three representative GAN models on 10 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.}

However, typical definitions of calibration only require this to hold on average, and offer no guarantees on predictions made on individual samples. Thus, predictions can be systematically over or under confident on certain subgroups, leading to issues of fairness and potential vulnerabilities. We show that calibration for individual samples is possible in the regression setup if and only if the predictions are randomized, i.e. outputting randomized credible intervals. Randomization removes systematic bias by trading off bias with variance. We design a training objective to enforce individual calibration and use it to train randomized regression functions. The resulting models are more calibrated for arbitrarily chosen subgroups of the data, and can achieve higher utility in decision making against adversaries that exploit miscalibrated predictions.}

In a wide range of datasets, we show that the resulting forests exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms such as random forests, AdaBoost or gradient boosting, often considerably, while yielding forests that have usually fewer and shallower trees and hence fewer parameters and faster inference overall.

We formulate the optimization of MetaVRF as a variational inference problem by deriving an evidence lower bound under the meta-learning framework. To incorporate shared knowledge from related tasks, we propose a context inference of the posterior, which is established by an LSTM architecture. The LSTM-based inference network can effectively integrate the context information of previous tasks with task-specific information, generating informative and adaptive features. The learned MetaVRF can produce kernels of high representational power with a relatively low spectral sampling rate and also enables fast adaptation to new tasks. Experimental results on a variety of few-shot regression and classification tasks demonstrate that MetaVRF delivers much better, or at least competitive, performance compared to existing meta-learning alternatives.}

In short, whereas the existing composition theorem, for example, relies on the central limit theorem, our new privacy bounds under composition gain improved tightness by leveraging the refined approximation accuracy of the Edgeworth expansion. Our approach is easy to implement and computationally efficient for any number of compositions. The superiority of these new bounds is confirmed by an asymptotic error analysis and an application to quantifying the overall privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent used in training private deep neural networks.}

To investigate this, we propose a scalable meta-gradient framework for learning useful intrinsic reward functions across multiple lifetimes of experience. Through several proof-of-concept experiments, we show that it is feasible to learn and capture knowledge about long-term exploration and exploitation into a reward function. Furthermore, we show that unlike policy transfer methods that capture ``how'' the agent should behave, the learned reward functions can generalise to other kinds of agents and to changes in the dynamics of the environment by capturing ``what'' the agent should strive to do.}

However, it remains unknown why this heuristic works well in practice. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical explanation for these methods. We prove that the prediction of a noisy classifier can indeed be a good indicator of whether the label of a training data is clean. Based on the theoretical result, we propose a novel algorithm that corrects the labels based on the noisy classifier prediction. The corrected labels are consistent with the true Bayesian optimal classifier with high probability. We incorporate our label correction algorithm into the training of deep neural networks and train models that achieve superior testing performance on multiple public datasets.}

Real-life graphs usually have complex information in the local neighborhood, where each node is described by a rich set of features and connects to dozens or even hundreds of neighbors. Despite the success of neighborhood aggregation in graph neural networks, task-irrelevant information is mixed into nodes' neighborhood, making learned models suffer from sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we present NeuralSparse, a supervised graph sparsification technique that improves generalization power by learning to remove potentially task-irrelevant edges from input graphs. Our method takes both structural and non-structural information as input, utilizes deep neural networks to parameterize sparsification processes, and optimizes the parameters by feedback signals from downstream tasks. Under the NeuralSparse framework, supervised graph sparsification could seamlessly connect with existing graph neural networks for more robust performance. Experimental results on both benchmark and private datasets show that NeuralSparse can yield up to 7.2\% improvement in testing accuracy when working with existing graph neural networks on node classification tasks.}

To do so, we define a new class of random variables (r.v.'s) which we term as left-sided sub-Gaussian r.v.'s; this class is a relaxed version of the sub-Gaussian r.v.'s. This enables the application of a sufficiently tight Bernstein-type concentration inequality. We show, through the derivation of a lower bound on the time complexity, that the performance of CascadeBAI is optimal in some practical regimes. Finally, extensive numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of CascadeBAI as well as the tightness of our upper bound on its time complexity.}

However, model outputs can vary dramatically on unlabeled data over different training stages, e.g., when using large learning rates. This can introduce harmful noises and inconsistent objectives over time that may lead to concept drift and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we study the dynamics of neural net outputs in SSL and show that selecting and using first the unlabeled samples with more consistent outputs over the course of training (i.e., "time-consistency") can improve the final test accuracy and save computation. Under the time-consistent data selection, we design an SSL objective composed of two self-supervised losses, i.e., a consistency loss between a sample and its augmentation, and a contrastive loss encouraging different samples to have different outputs. Our approach achieves SOTA on several SSL benchmarks with much fewer computations.}

In particular, we show that they produce surprisingly unsatisfactory performance for models where the support varies between executions, often doing no better than importance sampling from the prior. To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine, which remains efficient for such models, and show how it can be implemented as an automated and generic PPS inference engine.

This usually results in a network that is deep (to ensure performance) and yet thin (to improve computational efficiency). In this paper, we propose an efficient method to train a deep thin network with a theoretic guarantee. Our method is motivated by model compression. It consists of three stages. First, we sufficiently widen the deep thin network and train it until convergence. Then, we use this well-trained deep wide network to warm up (or initialize) the original deep thin network. This is achieved by layerwise imitation, that is, forcing the thin network to mimic the intermediate outputs of the wide network from layer to layer. Finally, we further fine tune this already well-initialized deep thin network. The theoretical guarantee is established by using the neural mean field analysis. It demonstrates the advantage of our layerwise imitation approach over backpropagation. We also conduct large-scale empirical experiments to validate the proposed method. By training with our method, ResNet50 can outperform ResNet101, and BERT base can be comparable with BERT large, when ResNet101 and BERT large are trained under the standard training procedures as in the literature.}

  abstract =   {Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithms have been shown to work favorably in solving large-scale learning problems. Despite the remarkable success, the stochastic gradient complexity of SVRG-type algorithms usually scales linearly with data size and thus could still be expensive for huge data. To address this deficiency, we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic minibatch proximal gradient (\HSDAN) algorithm for strongly-convex problems that enjoys provably improved data-size-independent complexity guarantees. More precisely, for quadratic loss $F(\wm)$ of $n$ components, we prove that \HSDAN~can attain an $\epsilon$-optimization-error $\EE[F(\wm)-F(\wms)] \leq \epsilon$ within $\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{0.75} \log^{1.5}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}) + 1}{\epsilon} \wedge \Big(\kappa \sqrt{n} \log^{1.5}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big) + n \log \big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big) \Big) \Big)$ stochastic gradient evaluations, where $\kappa$ is condition number. For generic strongly convex loss functions, we prove a nearly identical complexity bound though at the cost of slightly increased logarithmic factors. For large-scale learning problems, our complexity bounds are superior to those of the prior state-of-the-art SVRG algorithms with or without dependence on data size. Particularly, in the case of $\epsilon\!=\!\mathcal{O}\big(1/\sqrt{n}\big)$ which is at the order of intrinsic excess error bound of a learning model and thus sufficient for generalization, the stochastic gradient complexity bounds of \HSDAN~for quadratic and generic loss functions are respectively $\mathcal{O} (n^{0.875}\log^{1.5}(n))$ and $\mathcal{O} (n^{0.875}\log^{2.25}(n))$, which to our best knowledge, for the first time achieve optimal generalization in less than a single pass over data. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the computational advantages of our algorithm over the prior ones.}

  abstract =   {We study the problem of Robust Outlier Arm Identification (ROAI), where the goal is to identify arms whose expected rewards deviate substantially from the majority, by adaptively sampling from their reward distributions. We compute the outlier threshold using the median and median absolute deviation of the expected rewards. This is a robust choice for the threshold compared to using the mean and standard deviation, since it can identify outlier arms even in the presence of extreme outlier values. Our setting is different from existing pure exploration problems where the threshold is pre-specified as a given value or rank. This is useful in applications where the goal is to identify the set of promising items but the cardinality of this set is unknown, such as finding promising drugs for a new disease or identifying items favored by a population. We propose two $\delta$-PAC algorithms for ROAI, which includes the first UCB-style algorithm for outlier detection, and derive upper bounds on their sample complexity. We also prove a matching, up to logarithmic factors, worst case lower bound for the problem, indicating that our upper bounds are generally unimprovable. Experimental results show that our algorithms are both robust and about $5$x sample efficient compared to state-of-the-art.}

ParVIs have been proposed as efficient approximate inference algorithms and as potential alternatives to MCMC methods. However, to our knowledge, the quality of the posterior approximation of particles from ParVIs has not been examined before for large-scale Bayesian inference problems. We conduct this analysis and evaluate the sample quality of particles produced by ParVIs, and we find that existing ParVI approaches using stochastic gradients converge insufficiently fast under sample quality metrics. We propose a novel variance reduction and quasi-Newton preconditioning framework for ParVIs, by leveraging the Riemannian structure of the Wasserstein space and advanced Riemannian optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the accelerated convergence of variance reduction and quasi-Newton methods for ParVIs for accurate posterior inference in large-scale and ill-conditioned problems.}

Statistical inference can also be provided for the estimated parameters. Simulation studies and an application to the Ohio type 1 diabetes dataset show that our method could provide meaningful insights for dose suggestions with mobile health data.}

In online decision making systems, risk is a primary concern. In this regard, the mean-variance risk measure is one of the most common objective functions. Existing algorithms for mean-variance optimization in the context of MAB problems have unrealistic assumptions on the reward distributions. We develop Thompson Sampling-style algorithms for mean-variance MAB and provide comprehensive regret analyses for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandits with fewer assumptions. Our algorithms achieve the best known regret bounds for mean-variance MABs and also attain the information-theoretic bounds in some parameter regimes. Empirical simulations show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing LCB-based algorithms for all risk tolerances.}

To better understand adversarial robustness, we consider the underlying problem of learning robust representations. We develop a notion of representation vulnerability that captures the maximum change of mutual information between the input and output distributions, under the worst-case input perturbation. Then, we prove a theorem that establishes a lower bound on the minimum adversarial risk that can be achieved for any downstream classifier based on its representation vulnerability. We propose an unsupervised learning method for obtaining intrinsically robust representations by maximizing the worst-case mutual information between the input and output distributions. Experiments on downstream classification tasks support the robustness of the representations found using unsupervised learning with our training principle.}

We randomly choose a block of variables based on a uniform distribution, linearize, and apply a Bregman-like function (core function) to the selected block to obtain simple parallel primal-dual decomposition. We then establish almost surely convergence and expected O(1/t) convergence rate, and expected linear convergence under global strong metric subregularity. Finally, we discuss implementation details for the randomized primal-dual coordinate approach and present numerical experiments on support vector machine and machine learning portfolio problems to verify the linear convergence.}

The decision maker sequentially sets price in each time period and learns the unknown demand model, with the goal of maximizing expected cumulative revenue over a time horizon $T$. We prove matching upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal pricing policies, showing how the growth rate of random fluctuation over time affects the best achievable regret order and the near-optimal policy design. In the analysis, we show that whether the seller knows the length of time horizon $T$ in advance or not surprisingly render different optimal regret orders. We then extend the demand model such that the optimal price may vary with time and present a novel and near-optimal policy for the extended model. Finally, we consider an analogous non-stationary setting in the canonical multi-armed bandit problem, and points out that knowing or not knowing the length of time horizon $T$ render the same optimal regret order, in contrast to the non-stationary dynamic pricing problem.}

We demonstrate an explanation is the inaccuracy of existing gradient estimation methods: the adjoint method has numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method suffers from a redundantly deep computation graph. We propose the Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward- mode trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods. Furthermore, NODE with ACA can incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy.}

  abstract =   {Retrieving relevant targets from an extremely large target set under computational limits is a common challenge for information retrieval and recommendation systems. Tree models, which formulate targets as leaves of a tree with trainable node-wise scorers, have attracted a lot of interests in tackling this challenge due to their logarithmic computational complexity in both training and testing. Tree-based deep models (TDMs) and probabilistic label trees (PLTs) are two representative kinds of them. Though achieving many practical successes, existing tree models suffer from the training-testing discrepancy, where the retrieval performance deterioration caused by beam search in testing is not considered in training. This leads to an intrinsic gap between the most relevant targets and those retrieved by beam search with even the optimally trained node-wise scorers. We take a first step towards understanding and analyzing this problem theoretically, and develop the concept of Bayes optimality under beam search and calibration under beam search as general analyzing tools for this purpose. Moreover, to eliminate the discrepancy, we propose a novel algorithm for learning optimal tree models under beam search. Experiments on both synthetic and real data verify the rationality of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

Our transductive inference does not re-train the base model, and can be viewed as a graph clustering of the query set, subject to supervision constraints from the support set. We derive a computationally efficient bound optimizer of a relaxation of our function, which computes independent (parallel) updates for each query sample, while guaranteeing convergence. Following a simple cross-entropy training on the base classes, and without complex meta-learning strategies, we conducted comprehensive experiments over five few-shot learning benchmarks. Our LaplacianShot consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins across different models, settings, and data sets. Furthermore, our transductive inference is very fast, with computational times that are close to inductive inference, and can be used for large-scale few-shot tasks.}

While influenza epidemics occur every year, timing and size of the epidemic vary strongly from season to season. This complicates the public health efforts to adequately respond to such epidemics. Forecasting techniques to predict the development of seasonal epidemics such as influenza, are of great help to public health decision making. Therefore, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initiated a yearly challenge to forecast influenza-like illness. Here, we propose a new framework based on Gaussian process (GP) for seasonal epidemics forecasting and demonstrate its capability on the CDC reference data on influenza like illness: our framework leads to accurate forecasts with small but reliable uncertainty estimation. We compare our framework to several state of the art benchmarks and show competitive performance. We, therefore, believe that our GP based framework for seasonal epidemics forecasting will play a key role for future influenza forecasting and, lead to further research in the area.}

Fitting models of decision-making theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but current approaches limit the number of these models that we can fit to neural data. Here we propose a general framework for modeling neural activity during decision-making. The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on constraining the parameters of recurrent state space models, for which we introduce a scalable variational Laplace EM inference algorithm. We applied the modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator better captured the responses of a set of parietal neurons than a single accumulator model, and we identified a variable lower boundary in the responses of a parietal neuron during a random dot motion task. We expect this framework will be useful for modeling neural dynamics in a variety of decision-making settings.}

These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network based point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin. Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating their relational information.}
