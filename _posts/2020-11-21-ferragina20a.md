abstract: 'A recent trend in algorithm design consists of augmenting classic data
  structures with machine learning models, which are better suited to reveal and exploit
  patterns and trends in the input data so to achieve outstanding practical improvements
  in space occupancy and time efficiency. This is especially known in the context
  of indexing data structures where, despite few attempts in evaluating their asymptotic
  efficiency, theoretical results are yet missing in showing that learned indexes
  are provably better than classic indexes, such as B+ trees and their variants. In
  this paper, we present the first mathematically-grounded answer to this open problem.
  We obtain this result by discovering and exploiting a link between the original
  problem and a mean exit time problem over a proper stochastic process which, we
  show, is related to the space and time complexity of those learned indexes. Our general
  result is then specialised to five well-known distributions: Uniform, Lognormal,
  Pareto, Exponential, and Gamma; and it is corroborated in precision and robustness
  by a large set of experiments.'
