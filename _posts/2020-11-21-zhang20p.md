abstract: "We provide the first non-asymptotic analysis for finding stationary points
  of nonsmooth, nonconvex functions. In particular, we study the class of Hadamard
  semi-differentiable functions, perhaps the largest class of nonsmooth functions
  for which the chain rule of calculus holds. This class contains important examples
  such as ReLU neural networks and others with non-differentiable activation functions.
  First, we show that finding an epsilon-stationary point with first-order methods
  is impossible in finite time. Therefore, we introduce the notion of (delta, epsilon)-stationarity,
  a generalization that allows for a point to be within distance delta of an epsilon-stationary
  point and reduces to \x0Fepsilon-stationarity for smooth functions. We propose a
  series of randomized first-order methods and analyze their complexity of finding
  a (delta, epsilon)-stationary point. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound and show
  that our stochastic algorithm has min-max optimal dependence on delta. Empirically,
  our methods perform well for training ReLU neural networks."
