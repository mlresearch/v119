abstract: Unordered, variable-sized inputs arise in many settings across multiple
  fields. The ability for set- and multiset-oriented neural networks to handle this
  type of input has been the focus of much work in recent years. We propose to represent
  multisets using complex-weighted \emph{multiset automata} and show how the multiset
  representations of certain existing neural architectures can be viewed as special
  cases of ours. Namely, (1) we provide a new theoretical and intuitive justification
  for the Transformer modelâ€™s representation of positions using sinusoidal functions,
  and (2) we extend the DeepSets model to use complex numbers, enabling it to outperform
  the existing model on an extension of one of their tasks.
