abstract: Model fusion is an emerging study in collective learning where heterogeneous
  experts with private data and learning architectures need to combine their black-box
  knowledge for better performance. Existing literature achieves this via a local
  knowledge distillation scheme that transfuses the predictive patterns of each pre-trained
  expert onto a white-box imitator model, which can be incorporated efficiently into
  a global model. This scheme however does not extend to multi-task scenarios where
  different experts were trained to solve different tasks and only part of their distilled
  knowledge is relevant to a new task. To address this multi-task challenge, we develop
  a new fusion paradigm that represents each expert as a distribution over a spectrum
  of predictive prototypes, which are isolated from task-specific information encoded
  within the prototype distribution. The task-agnostic prototypes can then be reintegrated
  to generate a new model that solves a new task encoded with a different prototype
  distribution. The fusion and adaptation performance of the proposed framework is
  demonstrated empirically on several real-world benchmark datasets.
